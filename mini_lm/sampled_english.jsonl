It protects information from ransom attacks from intruders, Who can make your data unreachable unless a ransom payment is agreed using cryptocurrency. Individuals who can gain unauthorized access to the data on your system or networks can range from hackers who write scripts to try to compromise cybersecurity or organized criminal enterprises who will carry out technically advanced attacks, purely for illegal financial gain.\n\nSecurity Planning\n\nBusinesses rely on Business Continuity Plans (BCP) and Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP) for their security planning. Everyone must take cybersecurity seriously as ignoring this growing problem will eventually result in an IT disaster. Today, it forms an indispensable part of the risk management strategy for any organisation.\n\nCyber Security applies to everyone, no matter it is an individual who must ensure that software updates and virus protection is up-to-date, without failing. It also applies to huge organisations, who rely on specialists to ensure their IT infrastructure is fully protected with suitable planning in place, to recover from data breaches. IT is becoming more advanced and complex, so higher-level management should assure security, and that staff within the organisation is fully aware of the online risks.\n\nNo software is bug-free, and this makes it riskier. Bugs in software can create security issues, due for this reason, companies like Microsoft are releasing updates for their products such as Windows and Word. These updates include bug fixes but typically address security risks that may have been identified.\n\nCyber Security Training\n\nToday, IT users are often the cause of cybersecurity issues. Each user has a purpose different from one another when using a computer. While a few people have better knowledge about computer security, whereas many people do not. Every user must understand the cybersecurity risks and how they can work to reduce security breach risks.\nSome approaches that help in cybersecurity planning and programs are as follows:\n\nSoftware developers must not only able to develop software, but they should code in an approach that halts easy access to potential hackers. Any software developed should also be a PEN (Penetration) tested, this is a key element of cybersecurity, identify to developers security flaws within the software.\n\nTrain individuals to understand how to ensure the best security, such as ensuring business software and virus protection, has the latest updates applied.\n\nTraining end-users to be able to identify emails that are phishing or to not open attachments from unknown sources or social media.\n\nCyber Attacks\n\nNo business can be protected 100% from cyber attacks, regardless of the commitment each organisation has with cybersecurity. However, cyber-attacks usually occur through the most vulnerable point of access. These weak points are quite easy to secure, and if businesses follow basic cybersecurity protocol, the risk can be minimized. These security procedures which are also known as cyber hygiene include elements such as.\n\nThese are just the basics. Businesses must extend these practices much further to maximize their cybersecurity, as experienced hackers will find any weaknesses that may exist. With the advancement of technology, the security risks are now increasing in business computers, and at homes. There are now many physical systems that can be hacked, including:\n\nAutomotive systems\n\nAirlines systems\n\nInternet-enabled electronic devices\n\nAutomated systems such as traffic lights in a busy city\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT), also brings new challenges for cybersecurity. With more reliance on these systems, cybersecurity has never been more critical. New regulations, such as the GDPR, are adding further complications to cybersecurity. The GDPR, for example, has a clear security policy, with large GDPR fines for non-compliance. With cyber-attacks becoming more frequent and destructive, resulting in potentially huge financial losses for businesses as well as their credibility, businesses are looking to experience cybersecurity professionals to ensure their organisations are fully protected.\n\nFinding suitably experienced professionals has become a difficult task, with the sudden rise in cyber attacks, there is now a distinct shortage of suitable candidates for these high-end security roles.\n\nThe key elements of cybersecurity\n\nThe definition of cybersecurity needs to be understood more granularly. Businesses with cybersecurity strategies need to ensure that each of the subcategories is considered, overlooking any, potentially will leave organisations vulnerable.\n\nCritical infrastructure\n\nCommunities are relying on critical infrastructure for their day to day existence. These systems include hospitals, utility companies such as electric, gas or water, and automated systems used throughout cities such as traffic lights and railway crossings for example.\n\nThese critical infrastructure systems are linked to the Internet, and anything having internet connection is at risk of a cyber-attack. The organisations that manage the critical infrastructure must ensure the highest level of planning for cybersecurity, and continually re-evaluate their planning, contingency plans, and risk analysis/prevention is an ongoing process.\n\nNetworks\n\nProtection of data and information on a network within an organisation can be controlled with different levels of login/user access. Such a move limits the access for individuals within an organisation and for malicious users from outside the organisation that may have gained access.\n\nThere are specialised tools that control traffic on a network; these tools will also highlight potential risks. The issue with these tools is, they are continually generating data. Due to the thousands of logs that are created, genuine alerts may be missed in the process. With the continued advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, security software can identify and alert of imminent risks.\n\nCloud security\n\nMore organisations are storing and sharing data on the Cloud, such as:\n\nGSuite for emails, storage, and productivity\n\nDropBox and One Drive for storage\n\nXero for accounts\n\nOffice365 for productivity\n\nThis creates further issues about cybersecurity and also for new regulations like the GDPR. Poorly configured cloud solutions can result in cyber attacks, and it introduces a substantial risk. Cybersecurity is no longer under the control of your organisation. Businesses are relying on others to implement cyber security strategies. Organisations should carefully consider individual cloud solutions before leaping, perform due diligence to ensure these vendors also take cyber security seriously.\n\nApplications\n\nThe most vulnerable area for cybersecurity is web applications. With developers worldwide creating web applications, each development team has a different skillset and coding standards. Often developers have not created the systems with secure coding practices, leaving these systems vulnerable and prone to attack.\n\nWeb applications must be tested for security weaknesses by performing Penetration (PEN) testing. Software such as OWASP or Fortify will identify issues within web applications that can be addressed by the developers. PEN testing isn't a one-off procedure; the process must repeat at regular intervals as new hacking techniques become known, ensure the software is always secure.\n\nInternet of Things (IoT)\n\nThis can be related to any system that can be accessed via the Internet, such as automated lighting and heating at home, fitness apps tracking your daily actions or a speed sensor in a motor vehicle for an insurance company.\nIoT systems are installed, and the software or security updates are ignored. Such behavior can risk the privacy of the users of the IoT systems and also others as often the IoT systems are part of a botnet.\n\nWhat are the different types of cyber threats?\n\nCybersecurity is essential to protect against the three most common types of cyber attacks, as listed below.\n\nConfidentiality - this type of cyber attack is simply about gaining access to IT equipment to obtain personal information from an individual or a business. The data collected can be used for credit card fraud or identity theft to allow other documents such as passports to be produced. Certain countries may also use this approach to obtain personal information from governments for example.\n\nIntegrity or Sabotage - this cyber threat form, aims to corrupt information within online systems, making the systems unusable for the individuals relying on them. This type of attack can vary in size from just a minor corruption of data or substantial damage when criminals are typically looking to benefit from this type of cyber attack.\n\nAvailability: Ransomware is becoming a major problem by making systems unavailable to users by encrypting files. Unless a proper recovery plan is in place by the cybersecurity team, often the only way to regain access to the encrypted systems is by making a ransom payment, typically with untraceable cryptocurrency. DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are common by forcing large volumes of data across a network to make it inaccessible.\n\nHow are cyberattacks carried out?\n\nSocial Engineering - this approach is one of the oldest approaches used by criminals to gain access to valuable information. Viruses such as Trojan Horses can exist on websites, either intentionally or it's the unawareness of the website owner.\nVisitors to the web site may open files, and this leads to the virus being downloaded to their equipment allow the virus to gain access to personal information.\nAlthough cybersecurity can help to protect against this type of access, the best form of protection is the education of the users. Accessing trusted sites and to carefully consider files that are downloaded, are vital considerations.\n\nPhishing - one of the most common approaches to gain useful and personal information is by phishing. A genuine email may be received from what appears to be your bank, for example, requesting you to log in to your bank account. Information such as your username and password is then captured and re-used to gain access to your accounts. To avoid falling prey to phishing attacks, two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended, when logging into bank accounts for example, as not only is it necessary to log in to the website, but a second authentication can also be received the mobile phone, ensuring additional protection.\n\nOut of date software - software developers consider cybersecurity seriously, and new updates are regularly released not to fix bugs only but also to make sure that their software continues to be as secure as possible against cybersecurity attacks. It is critical that the software updates are installed by businesses, as software not kept up to date is more at risk of a cyber-attack.\n\nCybersecurity careers\n\nFinding the best team to manage your organisation's cybersecurity strategy is a difficult task. With forceful laws like GDPR taking effect in the European Union, the demand for cybersecurity sources is at its highest, and there is certainly a skill shortage.\nProtecting organisations data and infrastructure has never been more critical, with a cybersecurity team now requiring different skills from\n\nSecurity Engineer\n\nInformation Security Officer\n\nData Protection Officer\n\nPenetration Testers\n\nDedicated cyber security teams are now paramount and are in high demand with organisations ready to pay them hefty packages. The era has passed when cybersecurity may have been one of the tasks of one of the technical engineers. The cybersecurity roles are now specialist.\nCybersecurity is a 24/7/365 procedure, working around the clock to ensure internal systems are well protected and when a potential attack is identified, reacting quickly to rectify the attack. A rapidly changing environment that relies on a proactive team to continually protect the business's interests.\n\nThe following are key roles in the cybersecurity team.\n\nChief Information Security Officer (CISO)\n\nThis is the lead role in the cybersecurity team; the CISO oversees the cybersecurity department. The CISO defines the organisation's security policies and procedures and ensures that all security planning in place protects the organisation in the case of a cyber-attack.\n\n✓ Cyber Security Analyst\n\nThe Cyber Security Analyst plays so many key responsibilities within an organisation.\n\nEnsure that there is a security plan in place that has been fully tested. The plan should not be stopped, but kept updated and continue to evolve.\n\nProtection of data and files held within the organisation, ensuring that only the appropriate individuals can have access to these files.\n\nOngoing security audits both internally and externally. Accurate network systems should be present to prevent attacks. In the case of an intrusion, network tools should detect these intrusions and follow an incident response protocol.\n\nDefine and manage the organisation's corporate security policy.\n\n✓ Security Architect\n\nThe Security Architect stays in between the technical and management team. Their role is to ensure the organisation's network and security infrastructure are configured to meet the business's cybersecurity requirements. The Security Architect must have an excellent understanding of the businesses and technology to ensure that the solution implemented is the correct solution.\n\n✓ Security Engineer\n\nThis role within the cybersecurity team requires the Security Engineer to be at the forefront of the organisation. The individual needs to be able to communicate well throughout the business and have excellent technical skills to fulfill this role.\n\nThe key purpose of this role is to ensure that the infrastructure, network, and data centers are fully secure by the cyber security and to develop and evolve strategies that continue to protect the organisation's infrastructure.", "category": "other_information_services_information_security"}
{"text": "Book Review: 'Hotel Hyperion' by Lisa Gorton\n\nA room can be any distinguishable space within a structure, but Lisa Gorton's Hotel Hyperion takes the notion of a room to the grandest of metaphorical extensions, turning rooms into universes, into compartments in the brain, into moments of time and pockets of space. Hotel Hyperion is relatively short at only sixty four pages, but it is so densely packed that the work begins to expand into inflationary meaning as you go deeper into the poems, reading and re-reading. Though each of the poems stands alone and indeed many of the poems in the collection were published individually, there is an underlying story that links the work together. This is a story of memory, loss, history and hubris. It's a story about a new future and about the relics of the past that travel with us and are left behind as we transform-individually, and as a species. The poems are self-referential, memetic-with cultural ideas and motifs traveling from one poem to another, and metapoetic in a way that is somehow both humorous (at times) and profound.\n\nThe book is structured into five sections. The first, \"Dreams and Artefacts,\" is built around the Titanic Artefact Exhibition held in Melbourne in 2010. It is possible to see each of the sections as rooms, and each poem as a smaller room or contained within a room. The rooms are literal-a windowless interior: \"where Perspex cases bear,/each to its single light, small relics-\" but they're also metaphoric: \"a place less like place than memory itself -\". The Titanic is recreated in rooms that reference other rooms. They are real relics but they only exist in that dreamlike place of memory. In the 'now' of the exhibition, the clock has stopped, the staircase goes nowhere and the cities are imaginary: \"slow-mo historical epics with the sound down,/playing to no one.\"\n\nThe next section, \"The Storm Glass,\" takes its subject, a scientific instrument that was used on Darwin's voyage on the HMS Beagle, as the starting point. The Storm Glass was used to forecast weather through the condition of the liquid in its glass, presented in this context as a small sealed room. The liquid in the glass undergoes alchemy, changing and folding in upon itself to create a mini world, which is mirrored later in glitter filled snow domes. Though glass is a solid substance just as a room is a solid container, it is able to fold into itself-a modern multiverse that might exist in a different spatial dimension, making itself only known through gravity. Though the old fashioned science might be embarrassing to the modern scientist: \"it would embarrass/by the overconfidence of intention,\" it has retained its aesthetic beauty thereby transforming science into art: \"formalize the inwardness/of weather and contract hemispheres of wind//to a decorative instance.\" At the end of this series, it is still raining, harkening the rain at the end of the previous sequence. We are the reader who is \"walking out into the garden,/into the long rain breaking itself against the glass,\" participating in this art making and joining the world - the word made flesh. As we penetrate this room, we transform it.\n\nThere's a new journey in the title sequence \"Hotel Hyperion\". We're in the room of the future- 2020, as a mother sends her son off to Saturn's atmospheric moon. \"Press Release\", with its double entendre title-being both \"news\" and the idea of letting go into the world. The poem is tender, infused with longing, regret and bravado. Though this is a futuristic scenario, the heartache is one that will be familiar to any parent who has watched a child grow. The melding of timeless sentiment with a future context creates a powerful impact, drawing the reader further into the poem and readying us for the shift of person and room that we find in the next poem. In \"II The History of Space Travel,\" the child has become archeologist, reminding us of the Titanic Exhibition as we encounter the \"The Futures Museum.\" The rain continues to fall as the series progresses-treating images from earlier poems as memories and bringing us in and out of rooms that function in multiple ways-as worlds, as prisons, as spaceships, as places in the past that might or might not have existed and as containers for the present. The story that unfolds is evocative and oddly believable, but also surreal. The mingling of these disparate sensations creates a strong tension that drives the poetry along.\n\n\"Room and Bell\" presents a series of prose poems, growing around the artifact of a bell. There is so much going on in this series-nostalgia in the desire for home, the bending of time and co-mingling of past, present and future. At one point the past and the present converge through a mutual mirror:\n\n\"I know the room not as a place, not even as a memory, but as though some ghost of the future had whispered in my ear, 'Here you are', and permitted me to glimpse, this moment, the room as it will be when it exists only by my haunting.\" (33)\n\nThe transformation is chilling and clever. In some ways this also harkens to the folding universes of previous series as we fold into to who we once were.\n\nThe final series, \"The Triumph of Caesar,\" contains a number of ekphrastic poems. There are brief snapshots written as a tribute to Diena Georgetti, Michelle Nikou's tissue box sculptures, Roger Hiorns' 'Seizure', and of course Mantegna's painting, \"The Triumph of Caesar\", which gives the section its name. Though these poems beautifully and tenderly refer to and recreate the art around which they're built, they never lose the threads that bind this book together. The rooms, the rain, the folding universe, the compression and distortion of time, and that sense of scientific precision coupled with nostalgia are ever present. The poems grow outward built up of all the details of who we all are, who we've been and who we've yet to become-the story of the human race in its striking, precise frailty and beauty:\n\n\"Now nothing of the lived-in place but like a work of memory, where the flood was, insatiate the crystals mass edge upon edge and, self-repeating, consume scale models of themselves like facing mirrors, haunted by the rooms they make -\" (43, \"Homesickness\")\n\nHotel Hyperion is an extraordinary collection. It's packed full of motifs and imagery that are both strikingly original and uncannily familiar-like something picked out of the reader's own dreams. The poems are individually beautiful and evocative, and work perfectly as standalone pieces-calling to mind the themes around which they're built. They also work within the confines (rooms if you will) of their sections or series, but when the entire collection is taken as a whole, and the reader moves from room to room, thorough time and space the end result is almost shockingly powerful and deeply moving.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nAbout Magdalena Ball\n\nMagdalena Ball is the author of the novels Black Cow and Sleep Before Evening, the poetry books Repulsion Thrust and Quark Soup, a nonfiction book The Art of Assessment, and, in collaboration with Carolyn Howard-Johnson, Sublime Planet, Deeper Into the Pond, Blooming Red, Cherished Pulse, She Wore Emerald Then, and Imagining the Future.

{"text": "Action (theatre)\n\nAction as a term in Western theatre practice refers to a principle from actor training first developed by Russian actor and theatre director Konstantin Stanislavski in the first half of the 20th century at the Moscow Art Theatre. It forms part of his overall structure of systematized acting training, most frequently called the System, which in its turn gave rise to Method Acting.\n\nIn his writings on theatre, Stanislavski states \"The basis of theatre is doing, dynamism. [...] In Latin, the corresponding word is actio, and the root of this same word has passed into our vocabulary, \"action\", \"actor\", \"act\". So, drama is an action we can see being performed, and, when he comes on, the actor becomes an agent in that action\"  and \"acting is action - mental and physical.\" Jean Benedetti understands action in a Stanislavskian context more simply as \"What is done in order to fulfill a Task,\" a Task in its turn referring to \"What a character has to do, the problem he has to solve.\" Action as a term in theatre practice derived from the Stanislavski System therefore refers to that which a character undertakes in order to achieve a goal.\n\nReferences\n\n theatre", "category": "film_entertainment"}
{"text": "From nearly every angle, vistas are designed to galvanize the building with the UAB campus and the city of Birmingham. From one classroom, look right and Vulcan can be seen. Turn your head 90 degrees and the Stephens Center and UAB campus appear. Robert Palazzo, UAB's College of Arts and Sciences dean, credits the architect.\n\n\"One of the really nice thing that Randall did was to supply visual continuity to Birmingham and the rest of the campus,\" he said.\n\nBeneath its soaring, glassed-in atrium, the flexible gallery spaces and lecture hall will be put directly to use on Thursday, Jan. 16, when the building opens to the public. Two exhibitions, one of which showcases the university's holdings, will open in one of the small galleries. The other, titled \"Material Evidence,\" has more far-reaching implications for visual arts at the university and the city of Birmingham.\n\nNamed for principal donors Judy and Hal Abroms and Ruth and Marvin Engel, the institute seeks to bridge UAB's resources with those of the Birmingham Museum of Art, and \"Material Evidence\" is the first example. It is curated by BMA's Executive Director Gail Andrews, who drew from private collections of Birmingham residents, an unusually rich reserve of art.\n\n\"'Material Evidence' highlights the excellent and diversity of many of these private collections,\" Andrews said. \"We are incredibly grateful to them for their enthusiasm for this project and their willingness to share these objects with the public.\"\n\n\"It shows just how vast the attention to art is in this community, in terms of personal treasures and stewardship of art,\" he said. \"There is a culture of people who are really serious about art. I haven't seen that in a lot of other cities.\"\n\nNext to that exhibition is another that highlights UAB's collection, which will change every few months, once the collection is placed in storage in the building.\n\n\"The entire collection will be kept on site,\" said John Fields, interim gallery director and curator of the permanent collection. \"We haven't had proper storage facilities in the past. The permanent collection is a combination of student work to art by James Rosenquist, Robert Rauschenberg, Pablo Picasso, and now a pretty impressive Andy Warhol collection, which is still stored at the Museum of Art.\"\n\nWorking with other institutions on various projects is one of AEIVA's priorities.\n\n\"A major public research university partnering with a major urban museum is a pretty powerful combination,\" said Palazzo. \"If we maintain our sensibilities and look out for each other, it could bring more opportunity on the national and international levels than we could possible have done individually.\"\n\n\"There are grants appearing for the first time ever, where a university is influenced by a city's museum,\" said Theresa Bruno, Alys Stephens Center's corporate board chair. \"I haven't been in any gallery of this caliber that is also a teaching facility.\"\n\nBruno hopes that the university's arts facilities will create a \"cultural corridor\" that spans Tenth Avenue South, from AEIVA's sculpture garden to the Alys Stephens Center's Engel Plaza. Plans are already in the works for an across-the-street expansion of the \"Light Dreams\" projection show in May, and a textile show that promises to draw attention to the \"corridor.\"\n\n\"The textile artist Amanda Browder will be draping this building, and also the Stephens Center,\" she said. \"It's a mirror and a conversation between the two buildings.\"\n\nStill unresolved is the issue of crossing Tenth Ave. South. Parking for Stephens Center events remains behind AEIVA, and with the facility's opening, that activity that is expected to increase.\n\n\"We have to think about how that will be treated,\" said Palazzo. \"There is a safety issue there, and the possibility for larger-scale exhibits. We'll be working a lot with the city to alleviate the hazards. We've been going back and forth lately. We're hoping for some consideration.\"\n\nA tunnel underneath the street was one idea early on, but it had to be scrapped because a river bed flows under the street. Another solution is already in place -- police controlling traffic at various Stephens Center events.\n\nAs for AEIVA itself, Palazzo hopes the combination of exhibition and classroom space will enhance the education experience for UAB students.\n\n\"From an academic standpoint, that is the beauty of this,\" he said. \"We will have instruction, art making, art history and exhibition all in the same building. The ability to bring all of those things together will give our students an immersive cultural experience. We'll be able to approach education in a really comprehensive way that we weren't able to do before.\"See the previous post.", "category": "subject_education_education"}

{"text": "Integrated semiconductor memories have a memory cell array with a multiplicity of memory cells for storing digital information and also a logic area for driving the memory cell array and for operating the semiconductor memory. Storage is effected in storage capacitors, which are driven via a selection transistor situated at the crossover point between a word line, which electrically opens or closes the transistor, and a bit line. Further transistors are arranged in the logic area, and are formed differently and dimensioned differently than selection transistors of memory cells. In particular, the tradeoff between the requirement to minimize space in the memory area on the wafer and the desired analog switching behavior of transistors of the logic area yield different selection criteria for the design of the transistors for the memory and logic areas, respectively.\nOne design of the selection transistor in the memory area is the surrounding gate transistor. Ridges made of substrate material formed by a vertical anisotropic etching are used as a basic structure for the formation of the transistor. In this case, the patterned, usually elongate, ridge is covered with a gate dielectric and surrounded from all sides, except for the top side, with a surrounding gate electrode formed by a spacer technique. A trench capacitor is arranged at one end of the ridge. A first, lower source/drain region is formed by outdiffusion from the inner capacitor electrode of the trench capacitor. On the top side of the ridge, a second, upper source/drain is formed by implantation. In this way a vertical selection transistor is produced in the ridge above the trench capacitor. Alternatively, the vertical selection transistors can be formed in the interior of a capacitor trench above the storage capacitor.\nFurthermore, there are semiconductor memories with planar selection transistors in the memory cell array, which are arranged laterally with respect to the connected storage capacitors. These selection transistors do not have a ridge made of substrate material.\nThese designs of selection transistors are usually realized using field-effect transistors, in particular, MOSFETs (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors), in which, between two source/drain regions below a gate dielectric, an electrically conductive channel is formed by inversion of doped substrate material. The inversion channel has a channel length between the source and the drain, and a channel width, which corresponds to the optical resolution limit used.\nIn view of decreasing operating voltages and decreasing lateral dimensions of the memory cells with limited current density, the write and read speed cannot be increased sufficiently to the desired extent.\nMoreover, leakage currents, which flow, for example, via the electrical connection between storage capacitor and selection transistor, cause a an early discharge of the storage capacitor which, in the case of dynamic semiconductor memories, shortens the refresh period and increases the current consumption of the memory.", "category": "computer_communication"}

{"text": "This application claims the priority of German patent document DE 196 37 513.4, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.\nThe invention relates to the field of mechanical engineering and metallurgy, and concerns a process and an apparatus for treatment of metal workpiece surfaces by electrical discharges, like those that can be used advantageously for subsequent adhesive assembly for example, by gluing or welding for example, or for combined assembly processes, for example gluing, resistance welding, or adhesive and shaping connections.\nA number of problems arise in conjunction with gluing metal surfaces in industrial manufacturing. The most important condition for firm adhesion consists in the molecules of the adhesive being able to penetrate the surface of the substrate to a degree that allows the adhesion forces to become effective. Therefore, metal surfaces must be free of impurities (grease, oil, dust, and dirt). This is followed by mechanical pretreatment (brushing, blasting) and frequently by chemical pretreatment as well.\nBecause of the high, long-term stability that can be achieved in this fashion, classical chromium-sulfuric acid anodization for aluminum alloys has been employed largely unchanged for decades. This is especially the case in the aircraft industry. In order to make adhesive connections more stable with respect to environmental factors and especially to prevent breaks in adhesion caused by water diffusing inward, primer systems have been developed as adhesion promoters that are applied in very thin layers in order not to affect the overall behavior of the connection adversely. Epoxy resins have been the dominant adhesives for joining aluminum parts since the 1950s, said resins curing at temperatures of about 120.degree. C. and with relatively low applied pressures (approximately 1 bar). Special adhesives have been developed for gluing steel panels in the automobile industry, said adhesives being suitable for automatic manufacturing, medically safe, and resistant to oil to a limited degree.\nDespite the very high level of technological development of industrial adhesives overall, there are still several important shortcomings. Thus, pretreatment usually involves several costly worksteps and, to some extent, the use of chemicals that are medically objectionable or are problematic from the environmental standpoint. In addition, many technical solutions that have proven successful in manufacturing cannot be transferred to repair.\nAs an alternative to purely chemical processes, chemical and physical surface treatment processes are also employed that are much more advantageous as far as their environmental compatibility is concerned. In this connection, we can mention in particular the process of blast coating known by the name of SACO (O. Hahn, B. Motzko, \"Influence of the Process Parameters of SACO Surface Treatment on the Properties of Glued Stainless-Steel Connections,\" convention proceedings, Swissbonding 1994). In the SACO process, a corundum grain is used as the blasting medium, said grain being enclosed in a layer of silicate. When this abrasive strikes the surface of the substrate to be treated, a portion of the kinetic energy is converted into heat, and the silicate coating of the corundum grain suddenly breaks free of the grain and becomes firmly anchored in the substrate being blasted. The advantage of this process is that adhesion to the adhesive is largely independent of the material of which the parts being assembled are composed, since the adhesion is produced by the intermediate silicate layer. Thus, even materials that are conventionally difficult to glue together can be joined firmly to each other.\nThe problem that arises in this process is the development of dust that is necessarily associated with a blasting process, and which necessitates special work protection measures (particle sizes 1 to 10 .mu.m). This pretreatment therefore requires special shielding that makes it more difficult to use for repairs and makes it impossible to integrate into automated production processes.\nProcesses for treatment of surfaces of metal workpieces by means of electrical discharges under atmospheric pressure are described in a number of places in the literature and have been proposed for various applications.\nWhile the processes at the cathode of a vacuum arc discharge have been studied for a long time (L. P. Harris, \"Arc Cathode Phenomena,\" in: J. M. Lafferty (Editor), \"Vacuum Arcs, Theory and Application,\" Wiley, NY, 1980) and DC arcs in air have been used for a variety of applications (welding technology, switches), the processes that take place during brief arc discharges in a gas atmosphere at the cathode application point have thus far been investigated to only a limited extent. Such short-term discharges are characterized by the fact that no macroscopic arc application point constituting a liquid melt can form on the cathode, and the development of cathode erosion is characterized by the same microscopic craters as with a vacuum arc. Various characteristic erosion patterns develop as a function of the state of the surface (A. E. Guile and B. Juttner, \"Basic Erosion Processes of Oxidized and Clean Metal Cathodes by Electric Arcs,\" IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. Vol. PS-8 (1980), pp. 259-269). Depending on the type of gas and the duration of the discharge, net erosion decreases inversely with gas pressure (J. -L. Meunier and M. G. Drouet, \"Experimental Study of the Effect of Gas Pressure on Arc Cathode Erosion and Redeposition in He, Ar, and SF from Vacuum to Atmospheric Pressure,\" IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. Vol. PS-15, (1987), pp. 515-519). It has also been observed that an amorphous layer whose corrosion resistance is definitely higher than that of the basic material forms under the influence of brief arc discharges (Larikov, L. N. et al., \"The Formation of an Amorphous Layer on Fe.sub.86 B.sub.14 Alloy Under the Effect of a Spark Discharge, \" Metals Abstracts, Vol. 16, April 1983, p. 183, No. 56-0373; Metallofizika, 6 (1982) 4, 92-93). Technical applications, especially for adhesion technology, have thus far not been derived from these physical studies.\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,931,613 describes a process for improving the strength characteristics of steels containing silicon with the aid of electrical discharges. The processing electrode is kept constantly in contact with the workpiece in order to trigger a plurality of discharges by means of a pulsed current source. When the discharge is produced in this fashion, it is important to remember that the processing electrode likewise is severely eroded, and material is transferred from said electrode to the workpiece.\nGerman patent document DE 36 18 412 A1 describes a process for treating objects using electrical high voltage discharges, with the goal being to use the electrical field of the discharge to accelerate gas components against the surface of the object. This process therefore involves chemical treatment of the surface of the workpiece using an electrically activated gas (ozone, radicals, ions), with cratering being considered a disturbing effect. Another problem that arises in this connection is that such treatment creates large quantities of byproducts that are hazardous to health (especially NO.sub.x and O.sub.3).\nGerman patent document DE 42 25 106 A1 describes a process for producing a metal-plastic bond, especially for dental prostheses, with an adhesion-promoting oxide layer being formed on a metal part, said layer then being bonded with a dental plastic using an intermediate layer consisting of an adhesive silane. An electrical potential is maintained between the metal part and an adjacent electrode, and spark discharges are triggered as a silico-organic compound is introduced into the space between the electrode and the part. In this process as well, the emphasis is on electrochemical coating, while any roughnesses that may form are considered undesirable.\nThese adhesion-promoting layers based on silicon oxide, according to German patent document DE 34 03 894 C1, can also be produced at high temperature on selected areas of a metal dental prosthesis by reacting an oxidizable silicon compound in the gaseous state with a flame pyrolysis burner. The flame cone of the burner is guided over the part of the dental prosthesis to be coated.\nIn German patent document DE 40 12 086 A1, a process with the same basis is described that is intended to produce an adhesion-promoting layer for cathodic electrophoretic dip painting. In this case, zinc, aluminum, and their alloys are used as substrate materials in addition to iron. The fact that an adhesion-promoting layer made of silane is also applied gives the process its name, i.e. the \"silicoater\" process.\nAdhesion promoters of a completely different kind for aluminum adhesives, and therefore for aluminum materials as well, are described in German patent document DE 43 03 077 A1. The invention claimed therein relates to adhesion promoters that form a chelate complex with aluminum ions and that have a group that reacts with an epoxy resin adhesive.\nThe disadvantage of all processes using adhesion promoters is that they are complex multistage processes (cleaning, oxide formation, application of silane), in which, at each stage, environmentally harmful and poisonous or health-hazardous materials are used or released as byproducts.\nA goal of the invention is to provide a process and an apparatus for modification of metal workpiece surfaces by electrical discharges, by which multistage processes for surface modification can be avoided and modification takes place without using environmentally harmful, poisonous, and/or health-hazardous materials.\nThis and other goals have been achieved according to the present invention by providing a process for treatment of a metal workpiece surface, comprising: wiring a workpiece as a cathode; triggering and maintaining pulsed unipolar arc discharges between an electrode wired as an anode and a surface of the workpiece; controlling a duration of the arc discharges in order to avoid macroscopic melting of the surface of the workpiece; and controlling a repetition rate of the arc discharges in order to avoid macroscopic melting of the surface of the workpiece, and in order to guarantee complete extinction of each individual arc discharge.\nThis and other goals have also been achieved according to the present invention by providing a process for treatment and adhesive assembly of a metal workpiece surface, comprising: wiring a workpiece as a cathode; arranging an electrode at a distance from a surface of said workpiece which is to be subsequently adhesively connected to another surface, said electrode being wired as an anode; triggering and maintaining pulsed unipolar arc discharges between said electrode and said surface of the workpiece; controlling a duration of the arc discharges in order to avoid macroscopic melting of the surface of the workpiece; controlling a repetition rate of the arc discharges in order to avoid macroscopic melting of the surface of the workpiece, and in order to guarantee complete extinction of each individual arc discharge; moving at least one of said electrode and said workpiece in order to treat an entirety of said surface; and adhesively connecting said surface to said another surface.\nThis and other goals have also been achieved according to the present invention by providing an apparatus for treatment of metal workpiece surfaces as a pretreatment for subsequent adhesive or combined assembly, comprising: a workpiece wired as a cathode; an electrode wired as an anode; a generator comprising a high-voltage pulse source and one of a pulsed-current source and a component that consists of a laser and a pulsed-current source; and a controller controlling said generator to generate electrical pulses for triggering and maintaining pulsed unipolar arc discharges between the electrode and the surface of the workpiece.\nThis and other goals have also been achieved according to the present invention by providing an apparatus for treatment of metal workpiece surfaces as a pretreatment for adhesive connection, comprising: a workpiece wired as a cathode; an electrode wired as an anode and arranged at a distance from a surface of said workpiece which is to be subsequently adhesively connected to another surface; a generator comprising a high-voltage pulse source and one of a pulsed-current source and a component that consists of a laser and a pulsed-current source; and a controller controlling said generator to generate electrical pulses for triggering and maintaining pulsed unipolar arc discharges between the electrode and the surface of the workpiece, said controller: (a) triggering and maintaining pulsed unipolar arc discharges between said electrode and said surface of the workpiece, (b) controlling a duration of the arc discharges in order to avoid macroscopic melting of the surface of the workpiece, and (c) controlling a repetition rate of the arc discharges in order to avoid macroscopic melting of the surface of the workpiece, and in order to guarantee complete extinction of each individual arc discharge.\nAccording to the invention, in a process for modification of metal workpiece surfaces, by electrical discharges as pretreatment for subsequent adhesive assembly and/or combined assembly techniques, pulsed unipolar arc discharges are triggered and maintained between an electrode wired as an anode and the workpiece surface, with the workpiece being wired as a cathode, with the duration of an arc discharge being controlled in each case in order to avoid macroscopic melting of the surface of the workpiece and with the arc discharges following one another in a number and at a speed such that they do not lead to macroscopic melting of the workpiece surface and guarantee complete extinction of the individual arc discharges.\nAdvantageously, the arc discharges are triggered and maintained between the electrode and a part of the workpiece surface that is required for subsequent adhesive assembly and/or combined assembly techniques.\nIt is also advantageous that the work takes place at atmospheric pressure using active or inert gases or gas mixtures.\nThe present invention further provides an apparatus for modification of metal workpiece surfaces by electrical discharges as pretreatment for subsequent adhesive assembly and/or combined assembly techniques, said apparatus consisting of an electrode as the anode and a workpiece as the cathode, and a generator is also provided that consists of a high-voltage pulse source and a pulsed current source or a part that consists of a laser and a pulsed current source, to generate electrical pulses for triggering and maintaining pulsed unipolar arc discharges between the electrode and the surface of the workpiece.\nIt is advantageous for the high-voltage pulse source in the generator to be connected with the electrode through one diode and for the pulse current source to be connected with the electrode through another diode.\nAccording to one advantageous embodiment, a pulsed laser and a pulsed current source are utilized, with the laser being focused on the surface of the workpiece opposite the electrode.\nAccording to another advantageous embodiment, the radius of curvature of the electrode wired as the anode is much smaller than that of the surface of the workpiece opposite thereto.\nAccording to another advantageous embodiment of the present invention, a gas pressure above 100 Pa is maintained in the processing chamber.\nSpecial advantages are obtained when atmospheric pressure prevails in the processing chamber.\nThe present invention is also advantageously designed such that the processing chamber is flushed by a gas.\nAdvantages are also obtained if, in the apparatus according to the invention, the flushing gas enters the processing chamber through an opening in the electrode that is wired as the anode.\nAccording to the present invention, in order to modify a metal workpiece surface, only pulsed unipolar (in other words, not oscillating) discharges are used, with the electrode being connected with the positive pole of a pulsed voltage source. The term \"unipolar discharge\" means that the current flows essentially in one direction during the entire discharge process, in other words, there is no reversal of the flow direction, and that any current flowing in the opposite direction is very small by comparison to the current in the main direction.\nIt has been found that with a circuit of this kind using short pulsed light arc discharges (with a duration on the order of 5 to 100 .mu.s) it is mainly the surface of the workpiece and not the electrode (or only to a very slight degree) that is eroded. Furthermore, the brief pulses have the effect that the heat applied to the workpiece remains low. The discharges produce a local roughening of the surface of the workpiece. This roughening increases the effective surface and thus can improve the adhesion of adhesives, for example. It has been observed that this effect is pronounced in an advantageous manner when processing takes place under the influence of a gas, with a passive gas (for example a noble gas or nitrogen) or a gas that activates the surface (oxygen for example) or a mixture of gases (a mixture containing a halogen) being employed depending on the adhesive used and the materials to be joined. When the arc discharges are triggered by high-voltage breakdown, the discharge preferably begins at dielectric inclusions that can therefore be preferably eliminated. Since it is precisely these foreign substances that adhere poorly to the surface that cause problems during gluing, the desired effect is reinforced even further.\nThe apparatus and the process according to the present invention for modification of a metal workpiece surface using pulsed unipolar arc discharges produces a fine uniform roughening that constitutes a modification of the crystal structure in the surface area of the workpiece. As a result, in one process step and without using environmentally harmful, poisonous, and/or health-hazardous materials, a clean and oxide-free surface is produced on the metal workpieces being treated, said effect being especially advantageous for subsequent adhesive assembly and/or combined assembly techniques.\nAccording to the process and apparatus of the present invention, the strength of adhesive assembled connections, especially glued connections, is improved. The long-term strength of such assembled connections is especially improved.\nAdditional advantages of the process according to the invention and the apparatus according to the invention include the following:\nmodification takes place in one workstep, with the processing time being adapted to the degree of contamination; PA1 modification can be performed both completely automatically, for example by means of manipulators, and also visually, using a manual apparatus; PA1 modification can be performed at atmospheric pressure (no vacuum process being necessary); PA1 because the energy applied is very low and is limited to a surface layer a few microns thick, the modified workpiece can, for the most part, remain cool; PA1 modified and unmodified or insufficiently modified areas of the individual surfaces of the workpiece can be clearly distinguished by the unaided eye; PA1 modification can take place locally on areas of the workpiece that are relevant to subsequent assembly processes without affecting surrounding areas.\nOther objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.", "category": "other_manufacturing"}

If the latter, they may have been expelled by dying stars in the disc and are now falling back towards the disc\n\n(Image: NASA/ESA/A. Feild/STScI)\n\nWhat keeps the Milky Way's lights on? Giant gas clouds have been found close enough to home to keep the galaxy ablaze.\n\nAbout one sun-sized star is born in the Milky Way's starry disc every year, a process that requires a constant source of fuel. \"The gas associated with [star formation in] galaxies would have run out a long time ago, unless there's a source of gas from the intergalactic medium,\" says Christopher Howk of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.\n\nNow he and Nicolas Lehner, also at Notre Dame, think they've found a source in the Milky Way: fast-moving clouds of hydrogen raining down on the galaxy's disc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hydrogen is ionised, which makes it hard to detect. While atomic hydrogen can emit light, ionised hydrogen cannot. It can, however, absorb light, meaning it can be detected only if it lies in front of a bright background source.\n\nUncertain distance\n\nPreviously, brilliant galaxies in the distant universe called quasars had provided the backlight to detect ionised gas clouds suspected of fuelling new stars in the Milky Way's disc. But it was impossible to tell how far away the clouds were - they could have been anywhere between the Milky Way and the quasars billions of light years away.\n\nLehner and Howk used the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, one of the newest instruments on the Hubble Space Telescope, to observe 27 stars known to be within a vertical distance of 10,000 light years from the galaxy's disc. About half were obscured by gas clouds, meaning the gas must be within that same distance.\n\nThe researchers calculated the mass of the gas clouds to be equivalent to 110 million suns, providing plenty of fuel for new stars in the disc.\n\nMysterious origin\n\nBut the clouds' birthplace is still a mystery (see illustration). They could be structures that formed soon after the big bang and simply remained outside of any galaxy until falling into the Milky Way relatively recently.\n\nOr they could come from the Milky Way itself. Exploding stars in the galaxy's disc may have blown material outwards, and that material might now be falling back towards the disc in these clouds.\n\n\"I don't think we know it yet,\" Fraternali says. Determining the chemical makeup of the clouds with future ultraviolet telescopes could reveal the answer, since exploding stars create heavy elements that would not be present in \"primordial\" gas created after the big bang.", "category": "aerospace"}
{"text": "Q:\n\nChoosing a PhD topic\n\nMy supervisor and I recently had a long chat about PhD related stuff. He said something to the extent that your chances of employment after finishing your PhD among other factors depends on the topic of your PhD. The reason he mentioned was that for certain fields there aren't that many open positions. He mentioned that there are many open positions in the fields of Algebraic Geometry and also in Number Theory. \n(I will enumerate the questions to make it easier to answer)\nThe following are my questions: \n\n(1) Now I am wondering are there any other fields where research is\n  comparably active? Concretely, what are the top topic in pure maths\n  apart from AG and number theory that are \"in\"?\n\n(answer below does not address this question)\n\n(2) And in particular: are differential geometry and differential topology\n  among them?\n\n(answer below does not address this question either) \n\n(3) And which are the fields with the least open positions for lecturers?\n\n(answer below does not address this question either)\nI am passionate about more than one field hence I would like to choose the optimal topic from among the topics I am passionate about. I am prepared to move to just about anywhere. To make answers more precise and useful for others too maybe you could include geographical information in your answer. \n\nA:\n\nIf I have any advice for pursuing your Ph.D., choose something about which you are passionate and will maintain that passion over a period of 3-5 years.  If being employed after you finish is the main concern, keep this in mind: your success in your work will depend on your ability to learn new things, to finish small projects, to keep your verbal and written commitments, and to communicate with your colleagues.  \nI really feel that, while your field of expertise is important, you will be best served by working at something that your truly enjoy and will succeed at doing.  I have seen too many Ph.D. prospects flounder because such prospects treated their Ph.D. as a professional program .  Such people largely end up miserable because a Ph.D. takes too much time and dedication to treat as a hurdle in the way of your career development.  Rather, it is an opportunity to pursue something about which you simply want to do for its own sake, because you love doing it. If you are lucky enough to find the right combination of research opportunity and compatible advisor, then the career success will come by itself.\nThat all said, there is certainly a variation in opportunities over subfields.  I am not a professional mathematician and therefore do not have a feel for which positions currently have the best/worst opportunities for lecturing.  As far as which subfields in pure math are the \"hottest,\" keep in mind that some of the heat is driven by non-academic considerations.  Many mathematicians I know who are not in academia pursue computational geometry (believe it or not, but there are quite a few opportunities in semiconductors and electronics) and number theory (network security).  Lecturing opportunities in these fields are likely the best because of the employment demand (which goes against what I said above, sadly).  I am in the United States, so there may be different opportunities in other countries.\nIt sounds like you are interested in differential geometry and topology.  Your advisor is correct: there are few positions in academia.  But as I said above, if you focus on what you really want to do in graduate school and publish great work and make a name for yourself, you will find that, if you have geographical flexibility, you will find good work post-graduation.\n\nA:\n\nI will not tell you the answer to any of your questions, since I do not feel comfortable drawing conclusions in broad strokes from the data available to me. But I'll show you some data, and tell you how to find some more, so you can make up your mind for yourself. \nThe American Mathematical Society produces an Annual Survey of mathematical sciences, and among it contains information on the fields of studies of new doctoral recipients and their hiring statistics. If you go to this page you will find \"Supplemental Table E.3\" showing last year's employment statistics of new PhDs by field of specialty. From there you see that \n\nApplied maths is much more employed over all, with specifically biostatistics/statistics leading the field, this undoubtedly having to do with its industry applications. \nOf the traditional pure maths, the most popular is grouped under \"Algebra/number theory\", and in second place is \"geometry/topology\" (good for you!). \nYou also see that pretty much across the board for the pure fields, around 10% of the students were still seeking employment at the time of the survey. \n\n(This last point actually brings up something interesting: while your advisor is right that certain fields are more popular than others in terms of having more research interest and more jobs available, be aware that this also means that those fields usually have more people competing for those jobs. On average you are much better off trying to find a subject you enjoy and are good at, instead of finding a subject that has more absolute number of jobs. This is sort of the standard advice that you would get everywhere.)\n(I am also slightly surprised to see that the statistics have not improved since the economic bubble of 2008; for the more applied fields it seems the situation has slightly improved, though this is drawing on just 4 data points.) \n\nIn addition to the AMS data, an imperfect proxy for research interest is the number of arXiv postings per period of time. Of course you will need to adjust by typical length of paper, and other field-dependent cultural aspects to make the numbers really meaningful. \nFor employment availability, however, a simple way is to browse through the job postings at MathJobs. I do not know if there is a way to quickly filter by fields and such, but at worst you just have to read through every single job posting and categorize them yourself. \n\nA:\n\nMy advisor told me, twice, before accepting me (although he said that it is just to keep him with a clear conscience) that it is very hard to find a position with a Ph.D. in set theory today, and he remarked that my interest in the extremely pathological properties of models without the axiom of choice would make it even harder.\nHe added that if you're really good then you won't have an actual problem, but it's difficult to be that good. I am aware of the problems set theorists have in finding a position, especially in Israel nowadays where set theory is in decline.\nYou need to consider two things, I believe:\n\nAre you willing to move to another country? Or do you want to go back to your home land, or even home town? Perhaps to your current university? If you are willing to uproot it might be easier to find positions in your preferred topic.\nHow good do you think you can write about a topic you are less passionate about? I am currently in the midst of choosing the exact questions I will work on in my dissertation, but the process began with my advisor and me compiling a list of five possible topics, and a sixth one which I told him I may be interested in working on (as a topic that did not come up in the conversation). \nRegardless to the fact that all the topics we discussed about are very interesting to me, I kept drifting back to my own idea, and after a long period of two months where I was trying to fight it I gave in and decided that I really have to pursue the things I want to pursue, or else I will give up in the middle of the work.\nOf course, understanding all the things I want to understand I am bound to work on the other topics we had originally discussed, but my aim is solve another problem, and that's fine.", "category": "mathematics_statistics"}
{"text": "The inventive subject matter disclosed herein relates to an attachment system for a visor to a protective helmet, such as helmets used in motocross, other motorsports or protective helmets such as being used in downhill bicycling sports.\nProtective helmets are frequently used for recreational and vocational activities and sports. For example, protective helmets are used as head protection in motorsports, by jockeys in horse racing, in American football, ice hockey games, cricket games, and during rock climbing. Protective helmets are also used when performing dangerous work activities, such as hard hats used in construction work, during mining activities, and by police agents. Protective helmets are often required to be worn in transportation, for example motorcycle helmets and bicycle helmets.\nTypical helmet construction consists of a shell having a generally dome-shape structure which covers most of the user's head and having a view area or opening at the front. Motorcycle helmets in particular often have flip-down face screens for rain and wind protection, and they may also have projecting visors to protect the eyes from glare.\nThe conventional motocross and off-road helmet has elongated chin and visor portions, a chin bar, and partially open face to give the rider extra protection while wearing goggles and to allow the unhindered flow of air during the physical exertion of this type of riding. The visor is to allow the rider to dip his head and provide further protection from flying debris during off-road riding. It will also keep the sun out of the eyes of the rider during jumps.\nA visor is typically attached to the helmet by a coupling mechanism, for example, the visor may be attached to the helmet with mechanical fastener such as snaps, straps, or screws. Some of the prior art systems attach the visor to the helmet by interactions between the vents of the helmet and structural elements of the visor. For example, US 2009/0083900 describes a visor that can be affixed to a football helmet and allows an open view the helmet wearer's eyes. The visor attaches to the helmet by curving or snapping around reinforcement wires of the facemask of the helmet. Another example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,170,084, describes a visor that attaches to the helmet via a cantilever mechanism, such as a fin, that clicks into a mouthport of the helmet.\nThe typical visor attachment systems, however, do not allow the visor to detachably break away from the helmet upon impact without structural damage to the helmet and/or visor, nor do the prior art system allow for easy replacement of the visor in case the visor is broken or a different style is desired. Furthermore, the typical visor attachment systems do not allow the visor to be adjusted on the helmet in an upward or downward direction with an adjustment mechanism that is both reliable and user-friendly.\nAccordingly there is a need for a protective helmet that provides an improved attachment system for coupling a visor to a helmet and allowing release of the visor upon impact. Additionally, there is a need for improved adjustment mechanisms for repositioning a visor on a helmet.", "category": "sports"}
{"text": "CBN Communiqué No. 106 of the MPC Meeting - Mar 21-22, 2016\n\nTuesday, March 22, 2016 5.15PM / Central Bank of NigeriaThe Monetary Policy Committee met on 21st and 22nd March 2016 amidst dithering global economic prospects and continuing challenges in the domestic economy. In attendance were 8 out of the 12 members. The Committee appraised the international and domestic economic and financial environments in the first two months of 2016 as well as the outlook for the rest of the year.\n\nInternational Economic Developments The Committee noted with concern the further decline in global output at the end of 2015, which grew at 2.3 per cent, year-on-year in Q4, its slowest in three years, representing a 0.3 percentage point decline compared with 2.6 per cent in Q3.\n\nThis deceleration stemmed from the continuous slowdown of growth in the emerging market economies, worsened by deteriorating conditions in the Euro area and China as well as key emerging market economies. Other factors include sustained pressure in global financial markets arising from US monetary policy normalization, depressed global oil market and persistently weakened global aggregate demand.\n\nThe slowdown in growth in the US to 1.0 per cent in Q4 from 2.0 per cent in Q3 was attributed to slowdown in private consumption expenditure (PCE) and non-residential fixed investments. In Japan, output declined by 1.4 percentage points in Q4, 2015 in contrast to the 1.3 per cent growth recorded in Q3.\n\nThe Bank of Japan's monthly asset purchase program of ¥6.7 trillion ($56.71 billion) remains substantially sub-optimal, as the economy continues to lurch between contraction and expansion, with the adoption of a negative interest rate policy in January 2016.\n\nIn the Euro area, GDP grew by 1.5 per cent in Q4 of 2015, and projected to grow at 1.7 per cent in 2016. The European Central Bank (ECB), at its meeting on 10th of March, 2016 eased monetary policy by further reducing its refinancing rate to 0.0 per cent and deposit rate to -0.4 per cent. The Bank also expanded its monthly asset purchase program from €60 billion ($65.4 billion) to €80 billion ($87.2 billion) to further stimulate output growth and move inflation towards its long term objective of 2 per cent.\n\nOn the other hand, the Bank of England (BoE) sustained its stock of assets purchase, financed through the issuance of reserves at ₤375 billion ($536.25 billion), while retaining its policy rate at 0.5 per cent. The BoE further committed to investing ₤8.4 billion ($12.01 billion) of cash flows associated with redemption of the January 2016 government securities held in the Asset Purchase Facility, with a commitment to bringing inflation closer to the 2 per cent target, reducing unemployment and promoting growth.\n\nUncertainties and geo-political tensions in the Middle East, including a negotiated ceasefire agreement in Syria and Iran's re-entry into mainstream international oil market may 4 have further redefined conditions in the oil market. The market witnessed some uptick in prices following the resolve of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC members to pursue a higher anchor price, coupled with smaller-than-anticipated buildup in stocks at the Cushing Oklahoma delivery hub for United States crude futures. The Emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) were forecast to grow at 4.3 per cent in 2016, an improvement over the 4.0 per cent recorded in 2015. However, external and domestic challenges have persisted, stemming from low commodity prices, troubled financial markets, tepid global demand, policy uncertainty as well as continuously feeble growth in global trade. In addition, weaknesses in major emerging market economies, diminished capital inflows, rising borrowing costs and geopolitical factors have been identified as possible deterrents to growth in the EMDEs. In the environment of suppressed inflation, slow growth, weak global demand and volatile financial markets, the stance of monetary policy in the advanced economies is expected to remain accommodative in 2016, while in the EMDCs, it is expected to be underpinned by currency adjustments and other complementary policies.\n\nDomestic Economic and Financial Developments\n\nOutput\n\nThe Bank had adopted accommodative monetary policy since July 2015 in the hope of addressing growth concerns in the economy, effectively freeing up more funds for DMBs by lowering both CRR and MPR, with excess liquidity arising from the lower CRR warehoused at the CBN. DMBs were to access these funds by submitting verifiable investment proposals in the real sector of the economy. The funds have not impacted the market yet because the CBN was still processing some of the proposals submitted by the DMBs. In the first episode of easing which resulted in injecting liquidity into the Banking system, DMBs did not grant credit as envisaged. Moreover, the delay in passage of the 2016 Budget has further accentuated the difficult financial condition of economic agents as output continues to decline due to low investment arising from weak demand. The cautious approach to lending by the banking system underpinned by a strict regulatory regime conditioned by the Basel Committee in the post global financial crisis era has further alienated investors from access to credit as banks prefer to build liquidity profiles in anticipation of government borrowing. In the light of these developments, domestic output growth in 2015 remained subdued as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Consequently, real GDP grew by 2.11 per cent in the last quarter of 2015, more than half a percentage point lower than the 2.84 per cent recorded in the third quarter and 3.83 percentage points in the corresponding period of 2014. Overall, growth in 2015 was estimated at 2.79 per cent, compared with 6.22 per cent in 2014. The major impetus for growth continued to come from the non-oil sector which grew by 3.14 per cent in Q4, 2015 compared with 3.05 per cent in the preceding quarter. The key drivers of growth in the non-oil sector were Services, Agriculture and Trade; contributing 1.23, 0.83 and 0.76 percentage points, respectively.\n\nThe Committee noted that the sluggish growth in output was partly attributable to certain fiscal uncertainties, which inadvertently hampered investment spending and flows; intermittent fuel scarcity, increased energy tariffs (without commensurate improvement in power supply), foreign exchange scarcity as well as slow growth in credit to private sector in preference to high credit growth to the public sector. The Committee noted that many of these factors were outside the control of monetary policy and given these limitations, in the absence of complementary fiscal and structural policies, the only option was to continue with the existing measures. The MPC believes that complementary fiscal and structural policies are essential for reinvigorating growth.\n\nPrices\n\nThe Committee noted the increase in year-on-year headline inflation to 11.38 per cent in February 2016, from 9.62 per cent in January and 9.55 per cent in December, 2015. The increase in headline inflation in February reflected increases in both food and core components of inflation. Core 8 inflation rose sharply for the first time to 11.00 per cent from 8.80 per cent in January after a lull of three consecutive months at 8.70 per cent through December, 2015.\n\nFood inflation also inched up to 11.35 per cent from 10.64 per cent in January and 10.59 per cent in December, 2015. The rising inflationary pressure was traced to the lingering scarcity of refined petroleum products, exchange rate pass through from imported goods, seasonal factors and increase in electricity tariff. The Committee noted that the factors responsible for rising inflation were more structural in nature than monetary, but reaffirmed its commitment to monitor the developments closely and to work with the relevant authorities to address the underlying drivers of the upward price movements.\n\nMonetary, Credit and Financial Markets Developments\n\nBroad money supply (M2) grew by 2.29 per cent in February, 2016 in contrast to 1.69 and 0.25 per cent in January 2016 and February 2015, respectively. When annualized, M2 grew by 13.74 per cent in February 2016 against the provisional growth benchmark of 15.24 per cent for 2016. Net domestic credit (NDC) grew by 3.71 per cent in the same period, 9 annualized, at 22.26 per cent. At this rate, the growth rate of NDC was below the provisional benchmark of 29.30 per cent for 2016. Credit to the private sector grew by 1.45 per cent in February 2016, which annualized to a growth of 8.70 per cent, below the benchmark growth of 13.28 per cent. The Committee noted with concern, the dismal performance of growth in credit to the private sector, noting that even at that, credit went primarily to low employment elasticity sectors of the economy. Money market interest rates reflected the liquidity situation in the banking system Average inter-bank call and OBB rates, which stood at 0.5 and 2.77 per cent on 25 January 2016, closed at 4.00 and 5.00 per cent, respectively, on March 9, 2016. Between January 25th and end-February 2015, interbank call and OBB rates averaged 1.43 and 2.68 per cent, respectively. This was traced to liquidity surfeit in the banking system. The deposit money banks were, however, reluctant to grant new credit because of rising non-performing loans (NPLs), mainly in the oil sector, amongst other reasons. 10 The Committee also noted the slight improvement in the equities segment of the capital market during the review period. The All-Share Index (ASI) rose by 8.1 per cent from 23,916.15 on January 29, 2016 to 25,853.58 on March 14, 2016. Similarly, Market Capitalization (MC) rose by 8.02 per cent from N8.23 trillion to N8.89 trillion during the same period. However, relative to end-December 2015, the indices declined by 9.73 per cent and 9.74 per cent, respectively. |\n\nExternal Sector Developments\n\nThe average naira exchange rate remained stable at the inter-bank segment of the foreign exchange market during the review period. The exchange rate at the interbank market opened at N197.00/US$ and closed at N197.00, with a daily average of N196.99/US$ between January 25 and March 14, 2016. The Committee reiterated its commitment to maintaining a stable naira exchange rate. The MPC took note of the high level of activity in the autonomous foreign exchange market as well as the rising demand in the interbank market but observed that the data on demand 11 for foreign exchange had become 'very noisy', being overshadowed by speculative demand.\n\nHowever, the Committee charged the Bank to speed up reforms of the foreign exchange market to improve certainty and eliminate noise and opportunities for arbitrage.\n\nApparently, the conditions responsible for the slowdown - uncertainty around fiscal policy, adverse external environment, security challenges in some parts of the country affecting production and distribution of agricultural produce, low electricity supply, fuel shortages, and sluggish growth in credit to the private sector - have continued in the first quarter of 2016.On the monetary front, contrary to the notion of liquidity overhang in the financial system, the wider economy appears starved of the needed liquidity to spur growth and employment. Recent performance of the monetary aggregates lends credence to this fact. With the exception of credit to government, growth in all the monetary aggregates remained largely below their indicative benchmarks, yet; headline inflation spiked to 11.38 per cent in February 2016, substantially breaching the policy reference band of 6 - 9 per cent. Apparently, the increase in inflation was driven not so much by liquidity, but by structural factors such as fuel scarcity, increased electricity tariff, persistent insecurity, exchange rate pass through and seasonality of agricultural produce. The conflicting signals from slowing growth and rising inflation present a difficult policy challenge. Though mindful of the limitations of monetary policy in influencing the drivers of the current price spiral, the Committee stressed the need to urgently address the key sources of the pressures. In this regard, the Committee reaffirmed its commitment to closely monitor the development while working with relevant authorities to address the structural bottlenecks. From the monetary data, the Committee noted that the excess liquidity in the banking system was contributing to 13 the current pressure in the foreign exchange market with a strong pass-through to consumer prices. The Committee further noted that previous efforts to reflate the economy in order to spur growth did not elicit the required response from DMBs, hence; the surfeit of liquidity in the interbank market. Obviously, the attendant low rates at that market have not transmitted to the term structure of interest rates. Concerned about the need for low interest rates to support growth and employment, the Committee urged the CBN to explore innovative ways of ensuring the unhindered flow of credit at low cost to key growth sectors even as monetary policy has to, under the circumstance, address the liquidity surfeit in the banking system as well as the pressure on exchange rate and consumer prices. The Committee hopes that fiscal and other structural policies would soon be deployed to strengthen the overall response of macroeconomic policy to the shocks. The Committee was also concerned that with headline inflation at 11.38 per cent, noting that the policy rate had become negative in real terms. This development has the potential of keeping both foreign and domestic investments on hold. As part of measures to address the supply constraint in the foreign exchange market, yields on domestic instruments have to be competitive to attract the much needed foreign inflows. On the administrative side, this will have to be complemented by a comprehensive reform of the foreign exchange market which is currently being undertaken. For the avoidance of doubt, the Bank would continue to allow domiciliary account holders unfettered access to funds in their accounts. The Committee also enjoined the relevant agencies to speed up passage of the 2016 Budget in order to halt the depressing effect of the uncertainty that engulfs the waiting period, hoping that the implementation of the budget would go a long way in boosting business confidence, and reinvigorating the financial markets. In the circumstance, the Committee urged the Bank to continue to upscale its surveillance of the financial system with the aim of promptly detecting and managing vulnerabilities to ensure sustained stability. Finally, the Committee remains committed to price stability across the range of consumer prices, exchange rate and 15 interest rate, which is fundamental to reviving economic growth and employment generation. In the meantime, the Bank would continue to leverage its development finance policy to support critical sectors of the economy. The MPC also stressed the need to sustain, deepen and speed up reforms designed to ensure focused coordination of monetary and fiscal policies.\n\nThe Committee's Decisions\n\nThe Committee, in its assessment of relevant internal and external indices, came to the conclusion that the balance of risks is tilted against price stability. The MPC therefore, voted to tighten the stance of monetary policy. One member voted to retain the CRR at 20.00 per cent while another member voted to retain the current width of the asymmetric corridor. In summary, the MPC voted to:\n\n(i)Raise MPR by 100 basis points from 11.00 per cent to 12.00 per cent;\n\n(ii)Raise CRR by 250 basis points from 20.00 to 22.50 per cent; 16\n\n(iii)Retain Liquidity Ratio at 30.00 per cent; and\n\n(iv)Narrow the asymmetric corridor from +200 and -700 basis points to +200 and -500 basis points", "category": "finance_economics"}
{"text": "Consumers still unclear about CAS: Cybermedia Research\n\nThe Cybermedia survey on conditional access system gauges consumer awareness and channel preferences\n\nThe confusion surrounding conditional access system refuses to die down. A natural corollary is the increasing number of studies to understand the system, consumer awareness and channel preferencesÖ\n\nAccording to a recent market survey conducted in Delhi by Cybermedia Research, while 60 per cent of the chief wage earners and housewives are aware of the new system (which means they would be able to select channels of their choice and also pay accordingly), only 22 per cent are aware of terms like the CAS and set-top-boxes.\n\nThe Cybermedia Research dipstick survey was conducted in April-May 2003 targeting randomly selected 406 SEC A and B households; the chief wage earners or the housewives bring the main respondents.\n\nAs expected, the awareness levels varied in different strata of society and also by the type of respondents. Analysed by SEC, awareness was found to be higher in SEC A followed by SEC B. If analysed by respondent type, it was found to be higher among the chief wage earners compared to housewives. The fact that on an overall level (that is, among the entire universe of people surveyed), 40 per cent of the respondents are still not aware and 78 per cent are not sure about set-top boxes indicates that much needs to be done to demystify CAS and sell the concept of set-top-boxes among different categories of respondents.\n\nWith regard to preferred channels, respondents were provided with a card that listed 54 channels and were asked to recall (unaided) their preferred channels. STAR Plus was found to have the highest top-of-mind as well as total preference, followed by Sony. Interestingly, the third most preferred channel is Aaj Tak. This indicates that the demand for news channels is increasing. Another noteworthy point is that the top three channels in the preference list of consumers belong to three different media houses. The Government's decision of not allowing any media house to bundle channels would mean that revenue gains would be distributed among various media companies.\n\nThe number of channels likely to be subscribed to by a household in the CAS regime was found to be a function of the number of members in a family. Since a majority of the families in metros are nuclear with over 50 per cent in the sample having five or less family members, an equal percentage of respondents stated they would subscribe to just five to seven pay channels while another 27 per cent said they would subscribe to eight-10 channels.", "category": "news_media"}

{"text": "Writing multi-threaded applications      {#multithreading}\n===================================\n   \nMulti-threading allows applications to make use of all available CPU cores\non modern multi-core systems, providing an immediate performance boost.\nMRtrix uses the C++11 threads API to enable multi-threaded processing where\npossible. To facilitate development of multi-threaded applications, MRtrix\nincludes a number of classes that make it easy for many common workflows.\n\n\nOverview      {#multithreading_overview}\n========\n\nIn a nutshell, multi-threading refers to the concurrent execution of a number\nof light-weight processes (threads) that share a common memory address space.\nThis makes it very easy for processes to process shared data, but also very\neasy for one process to unexpectedly modify data that other threads are\ncurrently operating on. The biggest challenge in multi-threaded programming is\nmanaging concurrent access to shared resources and avoiding\n[race conditions]().\nConcurrent execution can introduce strange and unexpected bugs, often difficult\nto reproduce, and whose symptoms are often seemingly unrelated to the original\ncause. This makes multi-threaded applications very difficult to debug. For this\nreason, the best approach to developing multi-threaded applications is to keep\nthings simple and clearly organised, and to code with concurrency in mind -\neven if the class you might be writing is not designed to be used in a\nmulti-threaded context now, it might make sense later.\n\nThe most common strategy for managing concurrent access is the concept of\n[mutual exclusion](>)\n(a.k.a. mutex). Essentially, this involves identifying any shared resource that\nthreads will need to access, and programming access to this resource in such a\nway that each thread is guaranteed sole access to the resource while it\noperates on it. This essentially serialises access to the resource, ensuring\nthat each operation is completed before the next thread is allowed access. For\nexample, iterating through a set of data in a multi-threaded fashion might\ninvolve each thread locking a mutex as it fetches the next item of data to be\nprocessed from a queue. This ensures that no two threads end up with the same\ndata item to process, that no item accidentally remains unprocessed, etc. \n\nHow to design a multi-threading application      {#multithreading_planning}\n===========================================\n\nDesigning multi-threaded applications requires a different way of programming,\nboth to achieve a simple and robust solution that is not likely to crash, and\nalso to realise the expected performance gains. The single most important\naspect in the design process is how to structure the code to clearly define\nwhich bits are 'owned' by each thread, which bits are shared across them, and\nimplementing strategies to enforce this design.\n\n\n\nSharing read-only data      {#multithreading_shared}\n======================\n\nThe approach generally used in MRtrix applications is to define a class to hold\ndata that threads need read-only access to during processing. This class is\nthen initialised prior to creating and launching the threads, and is passed by\nconst-reference to the threads to prevent the threads from unintentionally\nmodifying the data. For example:\n\n~~~{.cpp}\nclass Shared:\n  public: \n    Shared () {\n      // initialise, etc\n      }\n\n    SomeType shared_parameters;\n    ...\n};\n~~~\n\nThis class might for example contain all the reconstruction parameters set by\nthe user, and any number of potentially large structures (e.g. matrices) that\nwill be used (but not modified) by the other threads. Once initialised, it is\nthen passed by const-reference to the thread class's constructor:\n\n~~~{.cpp}\nclass Thread {\n  public:\n    Thread (const Shared& shared) :\n      shared (shared) {\n        // any per-thread initialisation\n      }\n\n  protected:\n    const Shared& shared;\n    OtherType local_variables;\n};\n~~~\n\nThis structure helps to clearly delineate what is shared across threads and\nwhat is private to each thread. Using this construct, each thread class has\nread-only (const) access to the shared data, and any attempt at non-const\naccess to this data will result in a compile-time failure. This is a very good\nthing, since trying to debug subtle bugs introduced by race conditions can be\nvery frustrating, and any strategy designed to catch unintended access will\nsave many hours of exasperation further down the track.\n\n\nSharing read/write data     {#multithreading_concurrent}\n=======================\n\nTo allow thread-safe read/write access, the lowest-level approach is to design\nan additional class that encapsulates the data to be protected. This class\nprovides methods to access data items, and manages the mutex associated with\nthe data. For example:\n\n~~~{.cpp}\nclass SharedRW {\n  public:\n    ...\n\n    Item get_next () {\n      // note: this is pseudo-code!\n      lock_mutex();\n      Item item = list.pop();\n      unlock_mutex();\n      return item;\n    }\n\n    ...\n};\n~~~\n\nIn this example, access to the list is protected by locking and releasing a\nmutex before and after reading the next item from the list, ensuring no two\nthreads can modify the list's internal data structures concurrently (note the\n`lock_mutex()` & `unlock_mutex()` functions used in this example are for\nillustration purposes only - no such functions exist within MRtrix).\n\n\nAchieving maximum performance     {#multithreading_performance}\n=============================\n\nIdeally, using multi-threading would provide a speedup factor equivalent to the\nnumber of cores used. In practice, a number of issues might prevent this from\nhappening. Some of these are hardware-related (e.g. hyper-threading won't give\nall the performance benefits of a genuine multi-core equivalent CPU), some of\nthem are due to restrictions imposed by the algorithm to be implemented, and\nsome are caused by poor design of the implementation. While the first two are\ntypically unavoidable, there is a lot that can be done for the latter. \n\nThe first issue to consider is the overhead of the multi-threading calls.  Each\ncall to lock or release a mutex will take up CPU cycles due to the function\ncall and the need for the hardware to synchronise across all CPU cores. This\noverhead can become significant if run within a sufficiently tight loop, where\nthe processing itself might take up fewer CPU cycles than the mutex handling. \n\nAnother related issue is the cost of holding the mutex, in terms of its impact\non other threads. If the mutex is often locked, threads will spend a\nsignificant proportion of their time waiting for it to be released. This is\nparticularly the case if the amount of processing done while the lock is held\nis large in relation to the amount of work done while it is not held.\n\nThese considerations suggest that optimal performance is achieved by keeping\nthe rate of mutex locking low, and keeping the amount of work done while the\nlock is held small. This can often be done using simple strategies such as\npassing pointers to data to be processed, so that pushing or pulling them from\na mutex-protected list is quick. If the operation to be performed per item is\ninherenly small, these can be done in batches to reduce the amount of locking. \n\nThere are many other issues that can impact performance, such as non-optimal\nmemory access. If each thread is trying to access large amounts of data in\nseemingly random locations spread all over the RAM, the CPU will probably end\nup spending a disproportionate amount of time fetching data and flushing the\nCPU cache, resulting in poor performance. When this happens, multi-threading\nmay seem to provide no benefit, and might in fact adversely affect performance\ncompared to the single-threaded equivalent. It helps to think hard about your\ncode's memory access patterns to take advantage of the CPU's onboard cache and\nthe high burst transfer rates that can be achieved when the CPU can read large\nchunks of contiguous data. This is even more important when operating on\ndisk-backed data, where the cost of non-linear access can be considerable.\n\n\nMulti-threading API in MRtrix     {#multithreading_in_mrtrix}\n=============================\n\nMRtrix provides a number of constructs to simplify the process of writing solid\nmulti-threading applications. In most cases, the high-level \n@ref image_thread_looping and @ref thread_queue frameworks will be appropriate\nfor the particular algorithm to be implemented. If a more sophisticated\nimplementation is required, the C++11 threads API can be used directly.\n\n\n\nLaunching threads      {#multithreading_exec}\n=================\n\nThe MR::Thread::run() function is designed to launch and manage one or more\nthreads. This is done by providing one or more specially-designed thread\nclasses (or functors), whose `execute()` method will be invoked within the\nnewly-created thread. Multiple instances of the same thread class can be\nlaunched by wrapping the functor within the `MR::Thread::multi()` call when\npassing it to MR::Thread::run().\n\n@note If the class is to be used in multiple concurrent threads (i.e.\nlaunched using MR::Thread::multi()), the class must be copy-constructable,\nand any copy created in this way must be fully independent: if pointers to\nnon-const data or other complex structures are members of the class, there is a\ngood chance the default copy constructor will provide a copy referencing the\nsame data as the original, which would generally lead to race conditions if\nthese were written to during processing. Most of the classes provided in MRtrix\ndo copy-construct appropriately for use in multi-threading (for example\n[Image], [Adapter]), while others do not). That said, if all class members have\nappropriate copy constructors, the default copy constructor should also be\nappropriate.\n\nFor example:\n\n~~~{.cpp}\nclass MyThread {\n  public:\n    void execute() {\n      // do stuff\n    }\n};\n\n\nvoid run() {\n  MyThread thread;\n  auto exec = Thread::run (thread, \"my thread\");\n\n  ...\n  // do something else\n  ...\n\n  // invoking thread will wait for other thread to finish (join)\n  // in the thread class's destructor - i.e. when thread goes out of scope \n}\n~~~\n\nTo run it across multiple threads, use the MR::Thread::multi() wrapper. By\ndefault, the number of threads launched is determined from the C++11\n`std::thread::hardware_concurrency()` function, from the config file or from the\ncommand line.\n\n~~~{.cpp}\nvoid run () {\n  MyThread thread;\n\n  auto exec = Thread::run (Thread::multi (thread), \"my threads\");\n\n  ...\n  // do something else, or just wait for completion.\n  ...\n\n  // invoking thread will wait for all other threads to finish (join)\n  // in thread class's destructor - i.e. when exec goes out of scope \n}\n~~~\n\n\n\nThe ThreadedLoop           {#multithreading_loop}\n================\n\nIt is very common in imaging to process image voxels. The MR::ThreadedLoop()\nfunction and associated classes are designed to greatly simplify the process of\ncreating such applications. It allows the developer to provide a simple functor\nclass implementing the operation to be performed for each voxel, which can be\npassed to MR::ThreadedLoop() to be executed over the whole dataset. Refer to\n@ref image_thread_looping documentation for more information.\n\n\n\n\nThe Thread::Queue        {#multithreading_queue}\n=================\n\nIn many cases, an algorithm can be designed to process a stream of data.  For\nexample, data items are read in order from disk, and can be processed\nindependently. The results might then need to be written back to disk in a\nserial fashion. The MR::Thread::Queue class is designed to facilitate this type\nof operation. Please refer to the @ref thread_queue for a detailed description. \n\nThere is also a convenience function to simplify the setting up of\nthe queue structure, called MR::Thread::run_queue(). This also works with the\nMR::Thread::multi() wrapper where multiple parallel threads are desired. \nPlease refer to the [Thread module documentation[(@ref thread_classes) for details.", "category": "computer_programming_code"}
{"text": "The use of bath salts - synthetic cathinones with effects similar to methamphetamine and cocaine - has been associated with violent behavior, emergency hospitalizations and some fatalities among youth and adults in various parts of the country. In response, several state and local governing bodies and the federal government recently legislated bans on the active chemical ingredients in bath salts. These measures have created a new illicit drug market, which may significantly affect user experiences. Most of what is known about bath salts to date comes from emergency room reports and mass media coverage of extreme user experiences. However, it is also important to understand the experiences of users who may not end up in emergency rooms but who may be incurring other, as yet unknown, health risks related to the drugs. Scientific research to date is focused on toxicology, which is vitally important, given that bath salts makers frequently adjust the ingredient chemicals in order to evade law enforcement. Little is known, however, about the developing illicit market, or about subcultural and other social contexts that affect user experiences. The mixed-methods, 5-year investigation proposed here will start to fill that knowledge gap, by meeting the following aims: A. (Drug Market Integration) To scientifically document the integration of bath salts into the illicit drug markets, identify and document commonplace varieties of bath salts that are being sold, how they are sold, quantities being sold, variation in prices, access to products, street/brand names and name changes and how dealers manage users; B. (Role of Violence) To delineate the role of violence and document how and under what circumstances such violence co-occurs with bath salts use/sales, and how the illicit market manages such behaviors; a comparison with crack and methamphetamine will be examined to document how the market adjusts to integrate such behaviors; C. (Use Practices) To document use practices (set and setting) and conduct norms among bath salts users and to identify health problems occurring over time associated with use. Recruitment and data collection will be evenly divided among 4 cities: New Orleans, Houston, Galveston (TX) and New York. The research team has previously conducted market studies in all of these cities and has well established contacts among illicit drug users and sellers. Methods will include ethnography (n=80), focus groups (n=200) and survey (n=1,000). This study will complement ongoing toxicology research into bath salts, consistent with NIDA's mission to apply science to questions of drug abuse and addiction, and to do so in a cross-disciplinary way. Understanding subcultural and social contexts of bath salts use, including user perceptions and expectations, will serve the long-term goal of developing and implementing highly targeted prevention messages and treatment strategies.", "category": "biomedicine"}

Due to its thermoplastic elastomer properties, SEBS is commonly employed in commodities such as rubbers and plastics \\[[@B18-polymers-09-00481],[@B19-polymers-09-00481],[@B20-polymers-09-00481],[@B21-polymers-09-00481],[@B22-polymers-09-00481]\\], and its use in new specialized areas is also receiving growing interest \\[[@B23-polymers-09-00481],[@B24-polymers-09-00481],[@B25-polymers-09-00481],[@B26-polymers-09-00481],[@B27-polymers-09-00481],[@B28-polymers-09-00481],[@B29-polymers-09-00481]\\]. In industry, SEBS is not produced directly from olefin and styrene monomers, but instead by a two-step process that involves the costly hydrogenation of the PS-*block*-polybutadiene-*block*-PS (SBS) copolymer produced by the living anionic polymerization of styrene and butadiene \\[[@B30-polymers-09-00481],[@B31-polymers-09-00481]\\]. Indeed, the hydrogenation of polymers is not an easy process, so this requirement adds significantly to the manufacturing cost of SEBS.\n\nIn this context, we previously designed a strategy for the direct synthesis of PO-PS diblock copolymers from olefin and styrene monomers that involved coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) and subsequent anionic polymerization of styrene in a one-pot system ([Scheme 1](#polymers-09-00481-sch001){ref-type=\"scheme\"}a) \\[[@B32-polymers-09-00481]\\]. CCTP is an established technology that is actively employed in olefin polymerization reactions where precise architectural design and end group functionalization are required \\[[@B33-polymers-09-00481],[@B34-polymers-09-00481],[@B35-polymers-09-00481],[@B36-polymers-09-00481],[@B37-polymers-09-00481],[@B38-polymers-09-00481],[@B39-polymers-09-00481],[@B40-polymers-09-00481]\\]. In the CCTP process, PO chains are grown from a dialkylzinc (e.g., Et~2~Zn) to form (polymeryl)~2~Zn species. We discovered that PS chains can be subsequently grown from the generated (polymeryl)~2~Zn by feeding styrene monomer in addition to an anionic initiator such as *n*BuLi·(tmeda) (tmeda = tetramethylethylenediamine) or, preferably, Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta) (pmdeta = pentamethyldiethylenetriamine). We then attempted the preparation of SEBS-like PS-*block*-PO-*block*-PS triblock copolymers using a dialkylzinc species (i.e., \\[4-(isopropenyl)benzyl\\]~2~Zn, **1**) bearing the α-methylstyrene moiety, from which PO chains were grown by CCTP to generate di-end functional POs functionalized with Zn and α-methylstyrene moieties ([Scheme 1](#polymers-09-00481-sch001){ref-type=\"scheme\"}b) \\[[@B41-polymers-09-00481]\\]. PS chain growth from both ends was attempted, but anionic polymerization at the α-methylstyrene moiety was sluggish in the presence of the dialkylzinc species. We then examined the preparation of a multinuclear zinc species, i.e., Et-\\[Zn-(CH~2~)~6~\\]~3~-Zn-Et, from which the PO chain and subsequently the PS chain were biaxially grown in a one-pot process to generate the desired PS-*block*-PO-*block*-PS chains ([Scheme 1](#polymers-09-00481-sch001){ref-type=\"scheme\"}c) \\[[@B42-polymers-09-00481]\\]. However, the generation of PS-*block*-PO diblock chains (25 wt %) from the Zn-Et moiety in Et-\\[Zn-(CH~2~)~6~\\]~3~-Zn-Et was inevitable, and the molecular weight was reduced by one fifth after quenching, thereby leading to viscosity problems during the production of high molecular weight polymers. Thus, we herein report an alternative method for the construction of PS-*block*-PO-*block*-PS copolymers ([Scheme 2](#polymers-09-00481-sch002){ref-type=\"scheme\"}), which is expected to provide a number of advantages over previously reported methods.\n\n2. Experimental Section {#sec2-polymers-09-00481}\n=======================\n\nAll manipulations were performed under an inert atmosphere using a standard glove box and Schlenk techniques. Methylcyclohexane was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and purified over a Na/K alloy. The ethylene/propylene gas mixture was purified over trioctylaluminum (0.6 M in methylcyclohexane) in a bomb reactor (2.0 L). Styrene purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was purified by stirring over *n*BuLi·AlEt~3~ (2.3 mmol/300 g-styrene) for 3 days. Pmdeta was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and purified over CaH~2~. The ^1^H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were recorded using a Varian Mercury Plus 400 instrument. The gel permeation chromatograms (GPC) of the PS homopolymers were obtained in toluene at 40 °C using a Waters Millennium apparatus, while those of the POs and block copolymers were obtained in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 160 °C using a PL-GPC 220 system equipped with a RI detector and two columns (PLgel mixed-B 7.5 × 300 mm from Varian (Polymer Lab, Palo Alto, CA, USA)). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were recorded on a Carl Zeiss LIBRA 120 instrument. Complex **4** was prepared according to a previously reported literature method \\[[@B43-polymers-09-00481]\\].\n\n2.1. Preparation of (CH~2~=CHC~6~H~4~CH~2~CH~2~)~2~Zn *(**3**)* {#sec2dot1-polymers-09-00481}\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA solution of borane dimethyl sulfide (0.24 g, 3.2 mmol) was added dropwise to Et~3~B (0.94 g, 9.6 mmol) at room temperature with stirring. After stirring for 90 min, the resulting solution was added dropwise to a solution of divinylbenzne (80% technical grade, 3.8 g, 28.8 mmol) in anhydrous diethyl ether (5.3 mL) at −40 °C. After stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the volatile solvents were removed using a vacuum line at room temperature, and Et~2~Zn (0.83 g, 6.7 mmol) was added. The reaction vessel was then connected to a distillation apparatus and the system was thoroughly evacuated at −20 °C. Under these vacuum conditions at 0 °C, the transiently generated Et~3~B was selectively transferred for 5 h from the vessel to a receiving flask that was cooled using a dry ice/acetone bath. Excess Et~2~Zn and divinylbenzene were then removed from the reaction pot to the receiving flask by vacuum distillation at 40 °C, after which the reaction system was transferred to a glove box and methylcyclohexane (10 g) was added. The resulting insoluble black material was removed by filtration using Celite, and the obtained filtrate containing the desired **3** employed in the CCTP without further purification. The concentration of this solution was determined to be 72.3 mg/g by measuring the weight of solute following the removal of solvent from a portion of the solution (0.500 g), which gave an overall yield of 0.87 g **3** (83%). As indicated in [Figure 1](#polymers-09-00481-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"}, divinylbenzene employed in this step was a mixture of *para*- and *meta*-isomers and also contained traces of ethylvinylbenzene, thereby resulting in a complicated ^1^H NMR spectrum for the product. It should be also noted that Et~2~Zn is volatile and pyrophoric, and thus any collected solvent and byproduct were carefully quenched with water following dilution in mineral oil.\n\n2.2. Typical Procedure for the Synthesis of Block Copolymers (Entry 5 in [Table 1](#polymers-09-00481-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}) {#sec2dot2-polymers-09-00481}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo remove any catalyst poisons from the reactor vessel, a bomb reactor (125 mL) was charged with a solution of Me~3~Al (14.4 mg, 200 μmol-Al) in methylcyclohexane (17.0 g), stirred for 1 h at 100 °C using a heating mantle, and the solution removed from the reactor vessel using a cannula. After completing this washing step, the reactor was charged with a solution of (CH~2~=CHC~6~H~4~CH~2~CH~2~)~2~Zn (**3**, 45.0 mg, 150 μmol) in methylcyclohexane (45.0 g) under an inert atmosphere, and the temperature was set to 70 °C. The catalyst stock solution was prepared by reacting Hf complex **4** (18.1 mg, 25.0 μmol) with \\[(C~18~H~37~)~2~MeNH\\]^+^\\[B(C~6~F~5~)~4~\\]^−^ (30.4 mg, 25.0 μmol) in benzene (4.0 g). This catalyst stock solution (648 mg, 4.0 μmol-Hf complex) was subsequently injected into the reactor vessel using a syringe, and the system was immediately charged with a gaseous mixture of ethylene/propylene at 20 bar pressure, which resulted in a temperature increase to \\~125 °C within 5 min due to the exothermic reaction, despite cooling of the reactor with a fan. Following this initial increase, the reaction temperature began to decrease gradually due to catalyst deactivation, and was maintained between 95 °C and 100 °C. The pressure within the system gradually decreased, finally reaching 16 bar, due to consumption of the monomers, while the stirring rate decreased gradually from 300 to 130 rpm due to the formation of a thick viscous solution. After allowing the polymerization process to continue for 45 min, the remaining gas was vented off. During this procedure, the polymer solution swelled up to plug the valve and was withdrawn for GPC and ^1^H NMR analyses. When the temperature has reduced to 90 °C, a solution of Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta), prepared by mixing Me~3~SiCH~2~Li (14.1 mg, 0.150 mmol) and pmdeta (26 mg, 0.150 mmol) in methylcyclohexane (1.0 g), was added. The temperature was then maintained at 90 °C for 30 min with stirring, after which time styrene (7.8 g, 750 mmol) was injected. The temperature of the system was controlled in the range of 100--110 °C using a heating mantle, and the viscosity of the reaction mixture gradually increased over 5 h to the point where stirring was impossible. The complete conversion of styrene was confirmed by ^1^H NMR analysis of an aliquot of the obtained mixture, after which acetic acid and ethanol were successively injected. The obtained polymer mass was then dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 180 °C to give a mass of 24.1 g. After dissolving the polymer (2.8 g) in boiling chloroform (30 g), acetone (60 g) was added to precipitate the block copolymers. The PS-homopolymers, which were freely soluble in the chloroform/acetone cosolvent, were isolated initially via filtration. The resulting solution was then subjected to rotary evaporation and the residual solvent was completely removed in a vacuum oven at 80 °C over the course of several hours to obtain the PS homopolymers (0.21 g). The samples containing the PS homopolymers were then analyzed by GPC, TEM, DSC, and tensile tests.\n\n2.3. High-Temperature GPC Studies {#sec2dot3-polymers-09-00481}\n---------------------------------\n\nSample solutions (200 μL) containing 3000 ppm of the polymer substances were eluted in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 160 °C, and the mobile phase was stabilized with 2,6-di-*tert*-butyl-4-methylphenol (0.04%). The PS-based molecular weight distributions were calculated from a calibration curve on the basis of narrow PS standards (*M*~p~: 480; 915; 4715; 10,009; 20,681; 73,143; 197,736; 419,672; 1,047,000; 2,906,000; 4,714,000 Da). For calculation of the PO-based molecular weight distributions, the PS standard molecular weights (*M*~PS~) were converted to PE equivalents (*M*~PE~) using the reported Mark-Houwink-Sakurada parameters for PS (*K* = 0.000121; *a* = 0.707) and PE (*K* = 0.000406; *a* = 0.725) according to the equation: *M*~PE~ = \\[(0.000121/0.000406) × *M*~PS~^(1+0.707)^\\]^(1/(0.725+1))^ = 0.495 × *M*~PS~^0.990^, and further to PO equivalents using the equation *M*~PO~ = *M*~PE~/(1 − *S*) where S is the mass fraction of the CH~3~-side chains (i.e., *S* = (15 × *F*~C3~)/\\[(1 − *F*~C3~ ) × 28 + (*F*~C3~ × 42)\\]) \\[[@B7-polymers-09-00481],[@B44-polymers-09-00481]\\].\n\n2.4. Sample Preparation for Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) {#sec2dot4-polymers-09-00481}\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe triblock copolymer (5 mg) was dissolved in toluene (5 mL) at 100 °C, and a drop of the hot solution was loaded onto a carbon-coated copper TEM grid (200 mesh). Following slow evaporation of the solvent at room temperature overnight, the sample was annealed in an oven over 150 °C for 6 h, prior to staining with RuO~4~ by suspending the coated TEM grid for 30 min in a closed chamber containing an aqueous solution of RuO~4~, which was prepared by reacting RuO~2~ (30 mg) with NaIO~4~ (0.20 g) in water (5 mL) at 0 °C for 4 h.\n\n2.5. Tensile Tests {#sec2dot5-polymers-09-00481}\n------------------\n\nThe obtained polymer samples were compressed between hot plates at 135 °C and 5 MPa for 20 min followed by similar treatment at 10 MPa for 100 min. The obtained polymer films (\\~1 mm thickness) were cut into pieces (100 × 10 mm^2^), and tensile tests were performed according to the ASTM D882 standard test method using a UTM (WL2100, KOPTRI, Seoul, Korea) at a drawing rate of 500 mm/min with a gauge length of 50 mm at 25 (±2) °C and 45 (±5)% humidity. In the cyclic tensile test, each specimen was extended over 10 cycles to half of the distance of the breakage length measured in the tensile test.\n\n3. Results and Discussion {#sec3-polymers-09-00481}\n=========================\n\n3.1. Strategy for the Preparation of PS-Block-PO-Block-PS {#sec3dot1-polymers-09-00481}\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe strategy employed herein for preparation of the PS-*block*-PO-*block*-PS is similar to that attempted using the dialkylzinc species bearing the α-methylstyrene moiety ([Scheme 1](#polymers-09-00481-sch001){ref-type=\"scheme\"}b versus [Scheme 2](#polymers-09-00481-sch002){ref-type=\"scheme\"}). In the previous attempt ([Scheme 1](#polymers-09-00481-sch001){ref-type=\"scheme\"}b), a typical *ansa*-metallocene *rac*-\\[Me~2~Si(2-methylindenyl)~2~\\]ZrCl~2~ was used as the catalyst in the CCTP process. In that case, the styrene moieties took part in the CCTP either as chain transfer agents or as comonomers \\[[@B9-polymers-09-00481],[@B45-polymers-09-00481]\\], and so a dialkylzinc compound bearing the less reactive α-methylstyrene moiety was required. Although the α-methylstyrene moiety remained intact during the CCTP performed using *rac*-\\[Me~2~Si(2-methylindenyl)~2~\\]ZrCl~2~, it was sluggishly involved in the subsequent anionic styrene polymerization. Thus, we herein attempted the use of a dialkylzinc species bearing a styrene moiety instead of an α-methylstyrene moiety (i.e., **1** versus **3**) in addition to the use of pyridylaminohafnium catalyst **4** instead of *rac*-\\[Me~2~Si(2-methylindenyl)~2~\\]ZrCl~2~, as the former is reportedly a more efficient catalyst for the CCTP and prevents the undesirable β-elimination process \\[[@B1-polymers-09-00481],[@B7-polymers-09-00481],[@B8-polymers-09-00481],[@B42-polymers-09-00481],[@B46-polymers-09-00481],[@B47-polymers-09-00481]\\]. It should also be noted that the styrene moiety did not interfere in the CCTP performed using **4**. Indeed, the presence (or absence) of the styrene monomer during the ethylene/propylene copolymerization reaction using **4** had no effect on the transformation; yields were identical (14.5 and 14.2 g in the presence and in the absence of styrene, respectively) and the GPC data were either identical (*M*~n~ = 29800, *M*~w~ = 41,800 in the presence of styrene; *M*~n~ = 29,500, *M*~w~ = 41,100 in the absence of styrene). Moreover, no styrene-related signals were observed in the ^1^H NMR spectrum of the PO generated in the presence of styrene ([Figure S1](#app1-polymers-09-00481){ref-type=\"app\"}). In the other way, the styrene signals were observed at 7.2--5.0 ppm region ([Figure S2](#app1-polymers-09-00481){ref-type=\"app\"}) in the ^1^H NMR spectrum of a low molecular weight poly(ethylene-*co*-propylene), which was synthesized by feeding a high amount of **3** (Zn = 500 μmol) and by cutting the polymerization at an early stage (5 min).\n\nPreparation of the dialkylzinc species containing styrene moieties (**3**) was carried out through alkyl exchange between Et~2~Zn and the hydroboration product of divinylbenzene ([Scheme 3](#polymers-09-00481-sch003){ref-type=\"scheme\"}) \\[[@B42-polymers-09-00481],[@B48-polymers-09-00481]\\]. During the dynamic alkyl exchange process, the transient Et~3~B species was removed by evacuation at 0 °C, eventually leading to formation of the desired product, 3. As the employed commercial grade divinylbenzene is a mixture of para- and meta-isomers also containing traces of ethylvinylbenzene (80% purity), the obtained ^1^H and ^13^C NMR spectra were not clean; however, the major signals could be clearly assigned to compound **3** ([Figure 1](#polymers-09-00481-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [Figure S3](#app1-polymers-09-00481){ref-type=\"app\"}). In addition, it should be noted that **1** was synthesized by metathesis between ZnCl~2~ and the corresponding Grignard reagent, in which contamination by a small quantity of a magnesium-containing compound led to catalyst poisoning, so tedious recrystallization was required prior to use in the CCTP \\[[@B49-polymers-09-00481]\\]. In contrast, **3** prepared from alkyl exchange between Et~2~Zn and borane was suitable for use in the CCTP without any additional purification.\n\n3.2. Synthesis of PS-Block-PO-Block-PS {#sec3dot2-polymers-09-00481}\n--------------------------------------\n\nFollowing the development of a suitable strategy for the synthesis of PS-*block*-PO-*block*-PS, the CCTP reaction was performed in the presence of **3** (150 μmol) using **4** (4.0 μmol) activated with \\[(C~18~H~37~)~2~MeNH\\]^+^\\[B(C~6~F~5~)~4~\\]^−^ (1.0 equiv) as the catalyst. During this process, a ethylene/propylene gas mixture was fed into the system, and the polymerization temperature was maintained at 95--110 °C to prevent precipitation of the generated polymers. In addition, the propylene mole fraction (i.e., *F*~C3~ = \\[C3\\]/(\\[C2\\] + \\[C3\\])) was varied between 0.22 and 0.30 for the POs by controlling the propylene/ethylene ratio in the feed gas ([Table 1](#polymers-09-00481-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}). Indeed, the measured molecular weights (*M*~n~, \\~50 kDa) of the POs generated in CCTP process, after conversion to PO-equivalents by universal calibration, corresponded with the expected values calculated using the formula: PO weight (g)/(2 × Zn (mol)), and the molecular weight distribution was narrow (i.e., *M*~w~/*M*~n~ = 1.9) ([Table 1](#polymers-09-00481-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}). These results indicated that the CCTP proceeded successfully with the generation of di-end functional PO chains from **3**, where the generation of mono-end functional and non-functional PO chains was suppressed. When CCTP reaction was performed under the identical conditions using Et~2~Zn instead of **3**, the measured molecular weight (*M*~n~, 34 kDa, *M*~w~/*M*~n~, 1.69) of the generated PO deviated from the expected value calculated using the formula (i.e., 15.4 g/(2 × 150 μmol) = 51 kDa). The measured value corresponded with the value calculated based upon the assumption that PO chains were grown from the alkyl sites on both Zn and Al species (i.e., 15.4 g/(2 × 150 μmol + 3 × 50 μmol) = 34 kDa). We guess that the rapid alkyl exchange occurred between trioctylaluminum and diethylzinc, generating ethyl(dioctyl)aluminum, diethyl(octyl)aluminum, and triethylaluminum species, which participated in the CCTP process because of the loss of steric congest on the Al center. Such alkyl exchange might not occur between **3** and trioctylaluminum. Trioctylaluminum did not participate in the CCTP process, just acting as a scavenger.\n\nIn previous studies, Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta) was introduced as an efficient initiator to subsequently grow PS chains. In this case, the PS chains were grown preferentially from the R-groups present in R~2~Zn and also partially from the Me~3~SiCH~2~-moieties \\[[@B42-polymers-09-00481]\\]. Thus, following completion of the CCTP reaction, the anionic initiator Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta) (150 μmol, \\[Li\\]/\\[Zn\\] = 1.0) and the styrene monomer (7.8 g, \\[styrene\\]/\\[Zn\\] = 500) were introduced sequentially, with 30 min between addition of the initiator and the monomer. The amount of Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta) was controlled not to be higher than the amount of Zn (i.e., \\[Li\\] ≤ \\[Zn\\]) to avoid formation of PS growing site of free styryl-Li. At the condition of \\[Li\\] ≤ \\[Zn\\], we presume that the PS chains were grown solely from the zincate species, which underwent alkyl exchange reaction with dialkylzinc species. Immediately following the introduction of Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta), the original colorless solution developed a deep yellow color due to generation of the styryl anion, which was caused by Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta) attacking the styrene moieties at the ends of the PO chains. However, this yellow color decreased in intensity with time, likely due to the formation of a zincate species through attack of the generated styryl anions at the Zn centers \\[[@B50-polymers-09-00481]\\]. As a result, the viscosity of the product mixture also increased with time. Because the conversion of Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta) to styryl-Li·(pmdeta) was observed to some degree, we investigated whether styryl-Li·(pmdeta) could also trigger PS chain growth from R~2~Zn. Thus, when styrene polymerization was performed by the addition of a model compound of the styryl anion (i.e., CH~3~CH(Ph)-Li·(pmdeta), 0.50 equiv/Zn) to a methylcyclohexane solution containing styrene (500 equiv/Zn) and (hexyl)~2~Zn, the generation of PS with a narrow molecular weight distribution (*M*~w~/*M*~n~ = 1.25) was observed, where *M*~n~ = 21 kDa. The \\[PS growing sites\\]/\\[Zn\\] value calculated by the formula: \\[styrene\\]/\\[Zn\\]/DP (DP = *M*~n~/104), was 2.5, indicating that the PS chains were grown from all hexyl groups of (hexyl)~2~Zn, as well as from the initiator CH~3~CH(Ph)-Li·(pmdeta) ([Scheme 4](#polymers-09-00481-sch004){ref-type=\"scheme\"}). This result indicates that the conversion of the fed Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta) to styryl-Li·(pmdeta) is not relevant in the growth of PS chains from (polymeryl)~2~Zn.\n\nUpon the subsequent addition of the styrene monomer, the solution formed a deep yellow color, which persisted during the remainder of the polymerization process, thereby indicating that the active anionic styryl species was not destroyed even at a high polymerization temperature of 100--110 °C. The fed styrene was completely converted to PS, giving PS contents between 32 and 42 wt % based on the quantities of POs generated during the CCTP process. We expected that the excess styrene moieties present at the ends of PO chains participated in the polymerization of styrene as a comonomer, thereby resulting in attachment of PS chains at both ends of the PO chains.\n\nIn the ^1^H NMR spectra, both PS and PO signals were clearly observed at 7.2--6.5 ppm and 1.6--0.9 ppm, respectively ([Figure S4](#app1-polymers-09-00481){ref-type=\"app\"}). The selective extraction of PS homopolymers from the generated block copolymers was then attempted by a method previously developed in our group \\[[@B42-polymers-09-00481]\\]. In the ^1^H NMR spectra of the extracted polymers ([Figure S5](#app1-polymers-09-00481){ref-type=\"app\"}), the Me~3~SiCH~2~-end group signals were clearly observed at \\~0 ppm, thereby indicating that homo-PS was grown from the Me~3~SiCH~2~Li initiator. In addition, PO-related signals were observed at 1.2 and 0.9 ppm. Furthermore, in the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) traces, rather broad molecular weight distributions were observed (i.e., *M*~w~/*M*~n~ = 2--3) with distinct bimodal curves in many cases (entries 1, 3--4, 6--9, [Table 1](#polymers-09-00481-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}; [Figure S6](#app1-polymers-09-00481){ref-type=\"app\"}). The obtained NMR and GPC data therefore indicated that the block copolymers were extracted together with homo-PS. The *M*~n~ values of the homo-PS after elimination of the high molecular weight block copolymer by deconvolution ranged from 15 to 18 kDa (*M*~w~/*M*~n~ = 1.13--1.25), which corresponded with the values expected, assuming that PS chains were grown from all Zn-alkyl and Li sites (i.e., (PS weight, g)/(Li (mol) + 2 × Zn (mol)) = 7.8 g/(150 μmol + 2 × 150 μmol) = 17 kDa).\n\nThe homo-PS content (i.e., extracted PS (g)/total PS (g)) was particularly low (\\~23%). In this context, if Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta) is not involved in the reaction with the styrene moieties at the ends of the PO chains, the content of homo-PS grown from Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta) should be 33% (i.e., \\[Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta)\\]/(\\[Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta)\\] + 2 × \\[Zn\\]) = 150 μmol/(150 μmol + 2 × 150 μmol)). The observed lower homo-PS contents therefore conform with the aforementioned conversion of portions of the fed Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta) to styryl-Li·(pmdeta) through attack on the styrene moieties at the ends of PO chains. In contrast, when a model compound of styryl anion (i.e., CH~3~CH(Ph)-Li·(pmdeta)) was employed as the initiator instead of Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta), the homo-PS content was high (33%; entry 11).\n\n3.3. Characterization of the Block Copolymers {#sec3dot3-polymers-09-00481}\n---------------------------------------------\n\nResponse of the refractive index (RI) detector in the GPC instrument is opposite for the PO and PS samples ([Figure S7](#app1-polymers-09-00481){ref-type=\"app\"}), and so the quantitative analyses of the data are not reliable. However, as the attachment of PS-blocks should result in shorter retention time, the observed increases in both the *M*~n~ and *M*~w~ values after anionic styrene polymerization (Δ*M*~n~ = 27--54 kDa; Δ*M*~w~ = 29--61 kDa) confirmed their successful preparation. Upon shortening the time interval between the addition of Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta) and the styrene monomer to 10 min (entry 9), the *M*~n~ value was increased marginally (Δ*M*~n~ = 15 kDa; Δ*M*~w~ = 13 kDa). In addition, the GPC curves showed a clear overall shift after the anionic polymerization of styrene ([Figure 2](#polymers-09-00481-f002){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [Figure S8](#app1-polymers-09-00481){ref-type=\"app\"}), although the shift pattern differed somewhat from that observed in the batches prepared using the multinuclear Zn species Et-\\[Zn-(CH~2~)~6~\\]~3~-Zn-Et (**2**, [Scheme 1](#polymers-09-00481-sch001){ref-type=\"scheme\"}c) \\[[@B42-polymers-09-00481]\\]. In the latter case, regular-sized PS chains were attached at both ends of PO chains (hence, Δ*M*~n~ ≈ 2 × homo-PS *M*~n~), and the shift in the GPC curves plotted on the log(molecular weight) scale was substantial at low molecular weights, but was negligible upon moving to high molecular weights. However, in the cases where **3** was used, the shifts in the GPC curves plotted on the log(molecular weight) scale were substantial at both low molecular weights and high molecular weights ([Figure 2](#polymers-09-00481-f002){ref-type=\"fig\"}), and the molecular weight distributions were also broader (*M*~w~/*M*~n~ = 1.67--1.84) than those of the batches obtained using Et-\\[Zn-(CH~2~)~6~\\]~3~-Zn-Et (*M*~w~/*M*~n~ = 1.37--1.64). These data suggest that the generated block copolymers are not simple PS-*block*-PO-*block*-PS triblocks but instead contain higher blocks (e.g., PS-*block*-PO-*block*-PS-*block*-PO-*block*-PS), which can be generated when the chain-growing styryl anion connected to the PO chains attacks the styrene moieties at the ends of other PO chains. In an attempt to prepare diblock copolymer using Et~2~Zn instead of **3**, the molecular weight increment was marginal (Δ*M*~w~ = 1 kDa) because of aforementioned malfunction in the CCTP process.\n\nPhase separation between the PS and PO fragments was clearly visible by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after selectively staining the PS domains with RuO~4~ vapor ([Figure 3](#polymers-09-00481-f003){ref-type=\"fig\"}). More specifically, spherical PS domains measuring several tens of nm in size were distributed in the PO matrix in the sample containing a low propylene fraction (*F*~C3~ = 0.22; entry 1; [Figure 3](#polymers-09-00481-f003){ref-type=\"fig\"}a). Upon increasing the propylene fraction of the PO matrix, a number of these spherical domains collapsed to form wormlike structures ([Figure 3](#polymers-09-00481-f003){ref-type=\"fig\"}b,c). However, this phase separation was not as regular as that exhibited by commercial-grade SEBS ([Figure 3](#polymers-09-00481-f003){ref-type=\"fig\"}d). In addition, the prepared triblock copolymers did not exhibit the distinct glass transition (*T*~g~) signal of PS at \\~100 °C in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram ([Figure S9](#app1-polymers-09-00481){ref-type=\"app\"}) due to the observed phase separation. Weak and broad melting signals were observed in the range of 0--90 °C, as also observed in the DSC thermogram of SEBS.\n\nWe then measured tensile properties of the prepared block copolymers following compression of the polymer lumps into films of \\~1 mm thickness ([Table 2](#polymers-09-00481-t002){ref-type=\"table\"} and [Figure 4](#polymers-09-00481-f004){ref-type=\"fig\"}). As indicated, the tensile strengths were weak (2--3 N/mm^2^) at high propylene fractions (*F*~C3~ = 0.28--0.30) and the elongation at breaking point percentage values were low at high PS contents (e.g., 490% versus 770% at 38% and 32% PS contents, respectively; entry 4 versus 5). An outlier was observed for one sample (entry 2), where a low tensile strength (2.68 N/mm^2^) and low elongation at breaking point (300%) were observed even for a low propylene fraction (*F*~C3~ = 0.22) and a low PS content (33%). The GPC data of that sample also deviated from the normal, where Δ*M*~w~ (61 kDa) was significantly higher than Δ*M*~n~ (31 kDa). Such differences are likely due to greater quantity of higher blocks (e.g., PS-*block*-PO-*block*-PS-*block*-PO-*block*-PS) present in this sample. For the remainder of the samples, the values of Δ*M*~w~ and Δ*M*~n~ did not differ significantly. In addition, for the samples exhibiting a low Δ*M*~n~ (entry 9) and a high amount of homo-PS (entry 11), the tensile strength was particularly low (\\<2.0 N/mm^2^). The optimal data were recorded for the sample with an *F*~C3~ value of 0.25 and a styrene content of 33% (entry 5) as this sample exhibited a high elongation at breaking point (770%) comparable to that of commercial-grade SEBS (720%), although its tensile strength was lower. Indeed, SEBS is also known to exhibit an optimal elastomeric performance at *F*~C3~ = 0.25 and with a styrene content of 33%. In the cyclic tensile tests, the prepared triblock copolymers exhibited elastomeric behavior with no break over 10 cycles, which is comparable to the behavior of commercial-grade SEBS ([Figure 5](#polymers-09-00481-f005){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [Figure S10](#app1-polymers-09-00481){ref-type=\"app\"}). However, the sample containing a high quantity of homo-PS (33%) was broken prior to reaching 10 cycles (entry 11). For all other samples, in the first cycle, a degree of permanent deformation was observed, although this was followed by minimal deformation in subsequent cycles. This permanent deformation was somewhat greater in the prepared block copolymers than in commercial-grade SEBS.\n\n4. Conclusions {#sec4-polymers-09-00481}\n==============\n\nDialkylzinc containing styrene moieties ((CH~2~=CHC~6~H~4~CH~2~CH~2~)~2~Zn) was prepared by an alkyl exchange reaction between the hydroboration product of divinylbenzene (CH~2~=CHC~6~H~4~CH~2~CH~2~-BEt~2~) and Et~2~Zn. Poly(ethylene-*co*-propylene) chains were then grown from (CH~2~=CHC~6~H~4~CH~2~CH~2~)~2~Zn via CCTP using a pyridylaminohafnium catalyst to afford di-end functional PO chains functionalized with styrene and Zn moieties. The measured molecular weights (*M*~n~) of the POs generated via these CCPT reactions corresponded with the expected values calculated using the following formula: PO weight (g)/(2 × Zn (mol)). PS chains were subsequently grown from the generated di-end functional PO chains by introduction of styrene monomers in addition to the anionic initiator Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta). Counting of the PS growth sites from the measured *M*~n~ of the extracted homo-PS (7.8 g/17 kDa = 450 μmol) indicated that the PS chains were grown from all Zn-alkyl sites and Li sites (2 × 150 μmol-Zn + 150 μmol-Li). In addition, the obtained homo-PS content was low (\\~23%) due to the conversion of portions of the fed Me~3~SiCH~2~Li·(pmdeta) into styryl-Li·(pmdeta) species by attack at the styrene moieties at the end of the PO chains. The molecular weights of the obtained block copolymers increased after styrene polymerization (Δ*M*~n~ = 27--54 kDa). TEM images showed spherical and wormlike PS domains measuring several tens of nm, which were segregated in the PO matrix. In the cyclic tensile test, the majority of prepared copolymers exhibited thermoplastic elastomeric properties with no break being observed over 10 cycles, which is comparable performance to commercial-grade SEBS. The optimal tensile properties were observed for the sample containing a propylene fraction of 0.25 and a styrene content of 33% (tensile strength = 5.2 N/mm^2^; elongation at breaking point = 770%).\n\nThis work was supported by the Korea CCS R&D Center (KCRC) grant (No. 2012-0008935) and the Priority Research Centers Program (No. 2012-0006687) funded by the Korean Government (Ministry of Science, ICT and future planning).\n\nThe following are available online at <>, Figure S1: ^1^H NMR spectra of poly(ethylene-*co*-propylene) generated in the presence of styrene (**a**) and in the absence of styrene (**b**), Figure S2: ^1^H NMR spectra of a low molecular weight poly(ethylene-*co*-propylene), which was synthesized by feeding a high amount of **3** (Zn = 500 μmol) and by cutting the polymerization at an early stage (5 min), Figure S3: ^13^C NMR spectrum of **3** in C~6~D~6~, Figure S4: ^1^H NMR spectrum of block copolymer in C~6~D~6~ at 70 °C (entry 5 in [Table 1](#polymers-09-00481-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}), Figure S5: ^1^H NMR spectrum of the extracted PS homopolymer, Figure S6: GPC curve of the extracted PS homopolymer (entry 1 in [Table 1](#polymers-09-00481-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}), Figure S7: GPC curves for PO and PS samples showing that the RI detector response is opposite, Figure S8: GPC curves recorded before and after the anion styrene polymerization, Figure S9: DSC thermograms for triblock copolymers, Figure S10: Plots of the cyclic tensile test for triblock copolymers.\n\n###### \n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nBun Yeoul Lee conceived and designed the experiments and wrote the paper;

{"text": "Main menu\n\nYou are here\n\nVictorian bushfires by arson\n\nThu, 2009-03-26 23:34  -  Tigerquoll\n\nThe Australian Institute of Criminology reported last month that half of Australian bushfires are deliberately lit. Bushfire research needs to go further to evaluate whether in fact of the most damaging most are deliberately lit.\n\nTest: If one excluded arson ignitions and their related spotover fires (between 29 Jan at Delburn to 8 Feb) would the firestorms have occurred? Assuming the answer is no, then clearly arson must be Australia's key focus in combating the impacts of bushfire. Unlike the other two causes of bushfire, (lightning and accident) which are random, bush arson targets the worst conditions, upwind of a specific target and often involving multiple ignitions.\n\nThe term 'fire bug' is too docile and to start seriously dealing with it, we must change the perception and the language. Bush arson has become so deadly and catastrophic a crime that it warrants the term 'pyroterrorism'. See the application of this term in the recent California fires.\n\n\nThe forthcoming Royal Commission into the Victorian Bushfires of 2009 risks concluding similar theme recommendations as the 2004 COAG Enquiry into the 2003 Canberra Firestorm, which itself repeated those of many previous bushfire enquiries. The implementation of any recommendations requires budget, timeframe and an independent federal watchdog accountable to the public. I will be analysing its terms of reference.\n\nAside from serious resourcing of bush fire fighting (nationalising it, building approvals, building codes, etc), the key systemic problem is the cultural disconnect between bushfire research and fire fighting practice. Criminal arson investigation needs to be a permanent and dedicated arm of bushfire management, properly resourced with primary data collected from all Australia and overseas using the best criminal psychologists and with a proactive mandate.\n\nIn NSW, the government set up Strike Force Tronto to investigate serial bush arsonist after the Christmas 2001 bushfires. Then the government got complacent, other priorities emerged and it was disbanded in 2005. But following a series of arson bushfires in 2006 (with houses lost in (Picton and Cattai) the force was reinstated on 26 Sep 06 (Daily Telegraph p1). Reactive sporadic resourcing of bush arson investigation clearly isn't effective.\n\nTo seriously address the main cause of deadly bushfires, a national organisation needs to be permanently established and perpetually funded to focus on criminal investigation into bush arson/pyroterrorism with a mandate to recommend deterrent policies and practices across Australian bushfire fighting as well as the media.\n\nMedia reporting leading up to the 7-Feb-09 firestorms, simply incited dormant serial arsonists. Go back and read The Age and television media in the days before and after 29 Jan when the first bush arsonist struck at Delburn (south wast of Churchill). The front page of The Age on Saturday 7-Feb-09 read: '44 degree heat \"as bad a day as you can imagine\"\n- which was a quote from of all people the Victorian Premier made to the general public the day prior.\n\nJust like the media policy of not reporting suicides due it being known to encourage copy cats, so too media reporting of heatwaves and of extreme bushfire conditions needs to be tempered to avoid inciting dormant serial arsonists.\n\n________________________________________\nThis was a submission to the ABC TV Four Corners programme on the Victorian Bushfires 'Two Days in Hell' by reporter Quentin McDermott, ahead of it being aired Monday 16-Feb-09.", "category": "law_judiciary"}
{"text": "Sommeliers advice on how to serve and drink beer\n\nBeer is the new wine. As a culinary academy student you've probably heard that sentiment before. With the rise of craft breweries and the many options of artisanal flavors available, the once low-brow brew is now getting high-tier patronage. Beer sommeliers, or cicerones, are experts who can advise a bar patron on the best way to enjoy a pint. They have tips on the basic practices of serving and drinking beers.\n\nServing\nBeer Professor and President of Thirst for Knowledge Inc Roger Mittag spoke with Pass the Table, an app specializing in unique culinary experiences, about the proper way to serve a beer.\n\nMittag insisted on always pouring beer from a bottle or can into a glass to create a 1-2-inch layer of foam. When pouring from a bottle, can or tap, start the glass at a 45 degree angle and slowly straighten. A proper foam layer will create an enticing aroma and seal in carbon dioxide under the head.\n\nBeer Sommelier Sophie Atherton recommends using different glasses for different beers. In her interview with the Daily Telegraph in the U.K., Atherton indicated some beers may benefit from being sipped out of smaller glasses. She suggested British pubs should include a third of a pint serving option. Mittag advised serving lagers and pilsners in tall, narrow glasses and serving porters and stouts in large-mouth glasses.\n\nDrinking\nWhen it comes to drinking beer, you should take it slow. Certified Beer Cicerone Bill Sysak told Esquire magazine to begin with three small sips. The first sip should be swished around the mouth to cleanse the palette. The second sip should be done with open lips to let in air and prepare your palette. The third is where you truly taste the beer.\n\nThe U.K.'s Daily Mirror cited brewer Des McCann when it recommended chewing your beer. You want to move your beer all along your mouth as you imbibe in order for it to fully interact with your taste buds. Both Sysak and McCann believe beer can pair better with food than wine. Sysak said caramelized beers go great with beef and amber ales compliment vegetable dishes. McCann wanted diners to alternate bites of food with sips from their beer to really get the full taste experience.\n\nYou can consult experts at your preferred dining establishment to find which beer pairs best with certain foods or you can consult online resources and beer sommeliers apps on your phone to select your dining beverage.", "category": "accommodation_catering_hotel"}
{"text": "This invention relates to a tire chain for enhancing gripping of a tire in conditions of snow and ice and more particularly to the replacement of worn or broken cross members.\nTire chains as contemplated herein are intended for mounting to driven wheels of a vehicle when a roadway is covered with snow or ice. Mounting to non-driven wheels in addition to driven wheels is optional for maximum control in severe conditions. Additionally, the use of traction devices such as tire chains is required by law when driving on snow and ice covered roads in several states, notably California, Oregon and Washington. Tire chains are not intended for dry road surfaces and the chain\"\"s cross members (which wrap across the tire tread between two side members) will rapidly wear when driven on dry road surfaces. Thus, the chains are to be demounted from the tire as a vehicle enters and exits ice and snow laden road conditions.\nA vehicle needs to be driven at a reduced speed when driving on traction devices/tire chains. A chain component that breaks or comes loose can cause damage to the vehicle being driven at a high speed. Even at slow speeds a broken cross member requires that the vehicle be stopped and the tire chain repaired or replaced. The present invention is directed to a releasable securement device for releasably securing cross members to a tire chain side member as when replacing a broken cross member and particularly when cross member replacement is required by the vehicle\"\"s driver while on the road and between destinations.\nIt is to be understood that the terms traction chains, traction devices or tire chains refer to that product which includes a pair of circular side members designed to extend around the opposed side walls of a tire, the side members connected together by cross members that wrap across the tire tread from side member to side member. (See FIG. 1) The side members may be loops of cable, a steel hoop, plastic, composite material or loops of interconnected links. The cross members may be lengths of cable or lengths of interconnected links or plastic or composite material and the side members and cross members of a given chain may be any combination, i.e., cable cross members and cable side members, cable cross members and link side members, link cross members and cable side members or link cross members and link side members, composite cross members and link side members, cable cross members and steel hoop side members, etc.\nThe problem of cross member replacement has existed since tire chains were first adopted for enhanced tire traction on ice and snow. The problem has existed particularly for truck drivers having to traverse mountain regions when hauling loads cross country. The sheer weight and power of a large truck both accelerates the wearing of tire chains and the likelihood of cross member breakage when weakened by wearing. It is accordingly not uncommon for truck drivers to have to pull over along snow/ice laden roadways and replace a broken cross member. Not replacing or repairing the chain is not an option as the loose cross member is then whipped around the side of the tire and can wrap around or impact various objects in the vicinity of the wheel and cause immeasurable damage and safety hazards.\nHeretofore replacement of cross members typically required the removal or at least the loosening of the tire chain and then the wielding of a large pliar-like tool to force open a metal clamp securement device. A replacement cross member would then have to be secured to the side member again by the wielding of the pliar-like tool to squeeze shut the open clamp. Alternatively, and particularly when the pliar-like tool was not available to a driver, the cross member was repaired in a very temporary manner using a wire wrap or repair link to secure the cross member to the side member. Such was intended only for a temporary fix to enable the driver to limp cautiously to the closest point of shop repair hoping other cross members wouldn\"\"t break along the way.\nThe preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a secure, finger actuated snap lock-type releasable securement device permanently affixed to each end of a cross member. The cross member as initially assembled to the side member is snap locked to the side members by the securement devices. When replacement is required, the driver merely presses a spring of each securement device to allow disassembly by hand and a replacement cross member is snap locked to the side member in its place. The design of the invention also allows for actuation with common hand tools if desired.\nIn one embodiment, the clamp is a metal plate that is formed into a hook shape at one end and crimped at the other end onto the cross member. A metal spring (e.g., leaf spring) is anchored to said other end and extends to a position at the opening of the hook shape. A side cable or side link is pressed against the metal spring bending it out of the way as the cable or side link is forced into the hook. The metal spring snaps back to close off the opening and prevents removal of the side member except by intentional deflection of the metal spring.", "category": "automobile"}

The hierarchical control of a microgrid can be organized in three levels, primary, secondary and tertiary control as presented in [@Guerrero2011]. The primary control level, based on the droop control method, provides the power sharing between units, but it applies the voltage and frequency deviations according to the load demand. Then, the functions of the voltage regulation and the frequency restoration, which need communication to operate, must be implemented at a secondary control level [@Guerrero2011; @Bidram2013; @Simpson2015]. The tertiary control manages the power flow between the microgrid and the grid, considering the grid-connected operation.\n\nSeveral strategies for frequency and voltage restoration applied to the microgrid systems have been proposed [@Simpson2015; @Fanghong2015; @Ahumada2015]. In order to increase the system reliability by the addition of redundancy, the decentralized controller is preferred over the centralized one [@Simpson2015]. The secondary control can incorporates yet the cooperative characteristic, where each distributed source acts as an agent, which operates together with other agents to achieve a common goal.\n\nIn [@Qobad2014] one notes that the distributed secondary control presents an improved performance, considering the communication latency, when compared to the central secondary control. The impact of communication delays on the secondary frequency control in an islanded microgrid is shown in [@Shichao2015]. However, in this case the frequency restoration is implemented in a centralized controller using a proportional integral compensator. In [@Ahumada2015], robust control strategies for frequency restoration are implemented considering a variable and unknown time delay in data communication, but in this approach, a centralized secondary control is used, and additionally, the system control incorporates a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) to obtain the frequency at the bus loading.\n\nThe time delay effect on the system's stability has been the topic of investigation in several engineering applications by the use of delay differential equations (DDE). The spectrum analysis of DDE is more complicated than that of ordinary differential equations (ODE). The analytical solution is only possible in simple cases, where numerical approaches are used for practical systems [@Milano2012; @Zhang2006]. In these cases, the effect of the time delays on power system stability is presented.\n\nThis paper presents a small-signal modeling of a microgrid system operating in islanded mode, which presents a distributed control divided into primary and secondary levels. Frequency restoration based on a consensus algorithm is implemented in the secondary control level, which uses a specific control law and a data network. This data network presents a single time delay and its topology can be described using the graph theory.\n\nThe contribution of this paper is in its presentation of an approach for building a DDE model for a microgrid with a single load bus, which allows for stability studies, taking into consideration the secondary and primary control parameters, the data network topology and the communication time delay.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section \\[sec:1\\] presents the system control scheme. The proposed small-signal model of the system is presented in Section \\[sec:2\\]. In order to validate the proposed model, simulation and experimental results are presented in Section \\[sec\\_simula\\]. Section \\[Ext\\_model\\] shows that it is a simple task to extend the model over to a system with more inverter units. Details about a communication system with constant time delay and the packet loss are presented in Section \\[delay\\_packet\\]. Section \\[conclusion\\] presents the conclusion of the present work.\n\nThe Control Scheme {#sec:1}\n==================\n\nThe complete scheme of the microgrid considered in this work is presented in Fig. \\[Sys\\_scheme\\]. The microgrid is composed of an arbitrary number of inverter units. Each unit presents a hierarchical control, which integrates the inner control, the primary control and the secondary control [@Guerrero2011].\n\nThe inner control is composed of a current loop and an external voltage loop. In both loops Proportional Resonant (PR) controllers are used in $\\alpha-\\beta$ reference, considering the ideal function represented by (\\[ideal\\_PRes\\]), where $k_r$ is the proportional gain, $k_{res}$ is the resonant gain and $\\omega$ is the frequency of the resonant pole, which in this case is equal to the grid frequency. To keep the resonant pole over the system frequency, the frequency reference provided by the primary control is used for frequency tracking.\n\n$$G_{PR}= k_r + k_{res}\\frac{s}{s^2+\\omega^2} \n\\label{ideal_PRes}$$\n\nIn order to improve system stability, a virtual impedance is considered using the same implementation presented in [@Jinwei2011], where the voltage drops over the virtual impedance $V_{v\\alpha}$ and $V_{v\\beta}$ are described by (\\[Vvirtual\\]), being $Rv$ and $L_v$ the virtual resistance and inductance, respectively, and $I_{\\alpha}$ and $I_{\\beta}$ the inverter output currents in $\\alpha-\\beta$ reference.\n\n$$\\left[\\begin{array}{c} V_{v\\alpha}\\\\  V_{v\\beta}\\end{array} \\right] = \n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}     R_v        &   - \\omega L_v \\\\\n                     \\omega L_v        &            R_v          \\end{array} \\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{c} I_{\\alpha}\\\\  I_{\\beta}\\end{array} \\right]\n\\label{Vvirtual}$$\n\nThe primary control is based on the droop control method, which is capable of providing the active and reactive power sharing between the units without using communication, that is, only the local measurements are used. This control level is not capable of guaranteeing the equitable power sharing, since it is affected by the possible discrepancy of parameters between units, such as distinct line impedances. Besides that, the load affects the operational frequency and voltage.\n\nThe frequency and voltage droops used to control each inverter are described by (\\[pxd\\]) and (\\[qxv\\]), respectively, these present the gains $k_p$ and $k_v $. $Q_{eq}$ is reactive power at the equilibrium point, where the inverter operates with the voltage amplitude $E_{eq}$ and a frequency $\\omega_{eq}$. $P_{av}$ and $Q_{av}$ are the average active and reactive power measured by a data acquisition system in each inverter. $P_{ref}$ is the power reference of the frequency droop, a differentiated analysis to that presented in [@Coelho2002], where $P_{ref}$ was a constant and equivalent to the active power $P_{eq}$ at the equilibrium point. Here it represents an input variable that will be defined by the secondary control.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega&=&\\omega_{eq}-k_{p}(P_{av}- P_{ref})  \\label{pxd}  \\\\\nE&=&E_{eq}-k_{v}(Q_{av}- Q_{eq})            \\label{qxv}   \\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe algorithms for active and reactive power measuring use a first order low-pass filter with cut-off frequency of $\\omega_f$ , then the relationships between the instantaneous powers ($p$ and $q$) and average powers ($P_{av}$ and $Q_{av}$) measured by filters are:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nP_{av}&=&\\frac{\\omega_f}{s+\\omega_f} p  \\label{Pfilter}  \\\\\nQ_{av}&=&\\frac{\\omega_f}{s+\\omega_f} q  \\label{Qfilter} \\end{aligned}$$\n\nIn a microgrid system, the frequency restoration and the voltage regulation can be implemented by the secondary control, but a communication data link is necessary. In this work, a decentralized secondary control that performs only the frequency restoration function is presented. The control law implemented in each node of the distributed secondary control is described by (\\[secondcntr\\_law\\]). The goal of this controller is to eliminate the difference between the power reference of the $i-th$ inverter to the active power supplied by the others, as presented in Section \\[sec\\_2control\\]. The idea can be applied to an arbitrary number of units, but for the sake of simplicity, the model and its validation are presented considering only a three node system. Results for twelve-inverter system are presented in Section \\[Ext\\_model\\]. The data link network that connects all units presents a single and constant time delay.\n\n$$P_{refi} = - k_{pri}\\int \\sum_{\\substack{j=1 \\\\ j\\neq i}}^{n} (P_{refi}-P_{avj})dt\n\\label{secondcntr_law}$$\n\n![image](FIG1_15-TIE-2692.pdf){width=\"90.00000%\"}\n\nSmall-Signal Analysis {#sec:2}\n=====================\n\nIn order to facilitate one's comprehension of the proposed small-signal model, the math development is divided into 5 sections. Initially, the small-signal analysis for the primary control in each inverter is presented. Considering the admittance nodal equation, the connection between the nodes provided by the power network and the loads is analyzed. The consensus algorithm for the secondary control and the data network are presented, on which all links present the same arbitrary time delay. Finally, the complete model is presented. The respective time delay is considered constant in this work. This assumption corresponds to practical real-time digital communication setups, in which inter-processing times of the received packets are made constant, by means of buffering and use of sequence-numbers/time-stamps contained in the packets [@RTP]. In other words, the delay between two packet arrivals, that inevitably varies, can be assumed to be made constant, and the delay assumed in the paper is the upper bound of the total allowed delay in the system, made equal for all communication links. Another communication impairment that arises in practice are the packet losses, which can also account for the cases when the packet delay exceeds the upper bound. This impairment is not included in the analysis provided in this section. However, in the simulation results presented in Section \\[delay\\_packet\\], one also covers this aspect and shows that for a realistic packet loss probability that can be expected in practice, there is no significant difference between the results obtained by simulation and the results obtained by the small-signal model in which the packet loss probability is not included. More details are presented in Section \\[delay\\_packet\\].\n\nSmall-Signal Model for each Inverter Under The Primary Control {#subsec:21}\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConsidering the linearization around the equilibrium point specified by $\\omega_{eq}$, $E_{eq}$, $P_{eq}$, $Q_{eq}$ and the measuring filters described by (\\[Pfilter\\]) and (\\[Qfilter\\]) , one can rewrite (\\[pxd\\]) and (\\[qxv\\]) as:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\ns\\Delta\\omega&=&-\\omega_f \\Delta\\omega -k_p\\omega_f \\Delta p + k_p s\\Delta P_{ref} \\nonumber \\\\\n             & & + k_p\\omega_f \\Delta P_{ref}  \\label{dpxw}  \\\\\ns\\Delta E&=&-\\omega_f \\Delta E -k_v\\omega_f\\Delta q                \\label{dqxv}  \\end{aligned}$$\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that $P_{ref}$ is a variable, therefore two extra terms are implied in (\\[dpxw\\]) related to the deviation $\\Delta P_{ref}$ and its derivative.\n\nThe analytical calculations for the inverter voltage are the same as those presented in [@Coelho2002], those being, the inverter voltage $\\vec{E}$, this can be written using a coordinate system with direct-axis and quadrature-axis:\n\n$$\\vec{E} = e_d+je_q = E cos(\\delta) + j E sin(\\delta)\n\\label{vetor_e}$$\n\nwhere: $$\\delta = arc tan(\\frac{e_q}{e_d}) \\label{delta1}$$\n\nIt is important to emphasize that $\\delta$ is not the relative phase between output voltages of inverters connected to the system, but it is the absolute inverter voltage phase. Therefore, as one notes in Section \\[sec\\_simula\\], a redundant state and an eigenvalue at the origin [@Coelho2002] are implied. Besides this, as developed in [@Coelho2002], the reference voltage of each inverter obtained by the voltage droop is considered as being equal to the inverter output voltage, that is, the inverters are considered as ideal voltage sources.\n\nLinearizing (\\[delta1\\]) for a given $e_d$ and $e_q$ defined by the equilibrium point: $$\\Delta\\delta = \\frac{\\partial \\delta}{\\partial e_d} \\Delta e_d + \\frac{\\partial \\delta}{\\partial e_q} \\Delta e_q = m_d \\Delta e_d + m_q \\Delta e_q,\n\\label{delta2}$$\n\nwhere: $$m_d=-\\frac{e_q}{e_d^2+e_q^2} ,\\quad m_q=\\frac{e_d}{e_d^2+e_q^2} \\label{mdmq}.$$\n\nSince $\\Delta\\omega(s)= s \\Delta\\delta(s)$, then: $$\\Delta\\omega= m_d \\Delta \\dot{e_d} + m_q \\Delta \\dot{e_q}.\n\\label{omega1}$$\n\nConsidering that (\\[mod\\_e\\]) defines the amplitude of the inverter voltage, its respective linearization around the equilibrium point can be obtained by equation (\\[mod\\_e1\\]): $$E=|\\vec{E}|=\\sqrt{e_d^2 + e_q^2}\n\\label{mod_e}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = n_d \\Delta e_d + n_q \\Delta e_q\n\\label{mod_e1}$$\n\nwhere: $$n_d=\\frac{e_d}{\\sqrt{e_d^2+e_q^2}} ,\\quad n_q=\\frac{e_q}{\\sqrt{e_d^2+e_q^2}}.  \\label{def_ndnq}$$\n\nWhich implies that: $$s\\Delta E = n_d s\\Delta e_d + n_q s\\Delta e_q.\n\\label{mod_e2}$$\n\nSolving the equation system formed by (\\[dqxv\\]), (\\[omega1\\]), (\\[mod\\_e1\\]) and (\\[mod\\_e2\\]), isolating the derivatives $s\\Delta e_d$ and $s\\Delta e_q$, and considering (\\[dpxw\\]), one obtains the state equation (\\[state1\\]), which describes the behavior of the states $\\Delta\\omega$, $\\Delta e_d$, and $\\Delta e_q$ of the *i-th* inverter in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point. As one can see, the input of the state equation includes a term which depends on the deviation of apparent power that the inverter is supplying, and the all other terms are related to the reference average power deviation and its derivative. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\nonumber\n\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\Delta\\dot{\\omega_i}\\\\ \\Delta\\dot{e_{di}}\\\\ \\Delta\\dot{e_{qi}}\\end{array}  \\right] &=\\left[M_i\\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\Delta\\omega_i \\\\ \\Delta e_{di} \\\\ \\Delta e_{qi} \\end{array} \\right] + \\left[B_{si}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\Delta p_i \\\\ \\Delta q_i \\end{array} \\right]  \\\\ \n& + \\left[B_{ri}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\Delta P_{refi} \\end{array} \\right] + \\left[B_{di}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\dot{\\Delta P_{refi}} \\end{array} \\right]\n\\label{state1}\\end{aligned}$$\n\nor representatively: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\nonumber\n\\left[ \\dot{\\Delta X_{si}}  \\right] & =\\left[M_i\\right] \\left[\\Delta X_{si} \\right] + \\left[B_{si}\\right] \\left[ \\Delta S_i \\right] \\\\\n& + \\left[B_{ri}\\right] \\left[\\Delta Pref_i \\right] + \\left[B_{di}\\right] \\left[\\dot{\\Delta Pref_i} \\right] \n\\label{simb_state1}\\end{aligned}$$ where: $$\\left[M_i \\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}-\\omega_f   &   0   &   0   \\\\ \n\\frac{n_q}{m_d n_q - m_q n_d}& \\frac{m_q n_d \\omega_f}{m_d n_q - m_q n_d}& \\frac{m_q n_q \\omega_f}{m_d n_q - m_q n_d} \\\\\n\\frac{n_d}{m_q n_d - m_d n_q}& \\frac{m_d n_d \\omega_f}{m_q n_d - m_d n_q}& \\frac{m_d n_q \\omega_f}{m_q n_d - m_d n_q}  \\end{array} \\right]\n\\label{def_mi}$$\n\n$$\\left[B_{si} \\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -k_p\\omega_f   &   0  \\\\ \n   0  &  \\frac{k_v m_q\\omega_f}{m_d n_q - m_q n_d}  \\\\\n   0  &  \\frac{k_v m_d\\omega_f}{m_q n_d - m_d n_q} \\end{array} \\right]\n\\label{def_bsi}$$\n\n$$\\left[B_{ri} \\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}  k_p\\omega_f    \\\\ \n                                                0             \\\\\n                                                0      \\end{array} \\right]\n\\label{def_bri}$$\n\n$$\\left[B_{di} \\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}  k_p   \\\\ \n                                                0    \\\\\n                                                0      \\end{array} \\right]\n\\label{def_bdi}$$\n\nSmall-Signal Model for The Entire Microgrid Under The Primary Control {#subsec:22}\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe principle used to develop the model can be applied to a microgrid with an arbitrary number of nodes. However, in order to facilitate this development, an islanded microgrid will be examined; this is composed of three inverters connected in parallel to a common load bus, as visualized in Fig. \\[Sys\\_3invs\\].\n\nIn order to simplify the power network analysis, the effect of frequency variation over the frequency-dependent loads will be neglected, that is, the network reactances will be considered constant. This assumption can be considered reasonable because the droop controllers are designed to apply low deviations along the system frequency. It is important to keep in mind that the higher the system frequency range, the lower the precision of this modeling will be.\n\n![Parallel-connected inverters in an islanded microgrid[]{data-label=\"Sys_3invs\"}](FIG2_15-TIE-2692.pdf){width=\"0.65\\columnwidth\"}\n\nTherefore, neglecting the frequency variations, the nodal admittance equation for the islanded microgrid presented in Fig. \\[Sys\\_3invs\\] can be obtained considering the regular networked microgrid shown in Fig. \\[Y4bars\\], where the gray admittances are null and there is no inverter connected in the load bus.\n\n![Relation Between the Common Load Bus and Regular Networked Microgrids[]{data-label=\"Y4bars\"}](FIG3_15-TIE-2692.pdf){width=\"0.75\\columnwidth\"}\n\nHence, the nodal equation of the islanded microgrid is (\\[nodal\\_eq\\]), which in its representative form is (\\[snodal\\_eq\\]).\n\n$$\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\vec{I_1} \\\\ \\vec{I_2} \\\\ \\vec{I_3} \\\\ \\vec{I_4}\\end{array}\\right] =  \n\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc} Y_{ad}  &     0   &    0    &   -Y_{ad}  \\\\ \n                            0     &  Y_{bd} &    0    &   -Y_{bd}  \\\\\n                            0     &     0   &  Y_{cd} &   -Y_{cd}  \\\\\n                         -Y_{da}  & -Y_{db} & -Y_{dc} &  Y_{da}+Y_{db}+Y_{dc}+Y_{dd} \\end{array} \\right] \n%\\nonumber  \\\\  %used in \\small size  \n\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\vec{E_1} \\\\ \\vec{E_2} \\\\ \\vec{E_3} \\\\ \\vec{E_4} \\end{array}\\right] \n\\label{nodal_eq}\n%\\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n$$\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\vec{I_{1234}} \\end{array}\\right] = \n\\left[\\begin{array}{c} Y      \\end{array} \\right] \n\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\vec{E_{1234}} \\end{array}\\right] \\\\.\n\\label{snodal_eq}$$\n\nSince there is no power injection on node 4 and the all power consumption is represented by the respective shunt load included in the admittance matrix $Y$, the voltage at node 4 is a linear combination of the voltage on the other 3 nodes.

Thus, in order to perform this function, the secondary control modifies the power reference $P_{refi}$ of the frequency droop in each inverter.\n\nThe islanded microgrid presented in Fig. \\[Sys\\_3invs\\] can be considered as a power network where there is a consensus to provide the power sharing, and where the frequency and voltage droops are the distributed controllers. This consensus keeps the system stable and in steady state all inverters operate at the same frequency, not necessarily the nominal frequency. The load sharing and the equilibrium frequency depend on the load and the setpoints of the reference power in each inverter. Thus, another network will be used for implementing the frequency restoration that being a data link network. This new network can be presented in several topologies. A strongly connected example [@Rezasaber2004] is shown in Fig. \\[Consensus\\_Sys\\], where only three inverters are considered.\n\n![Directed Graph for Secondary Control[]{data-label=\"Consensus_Sys\"}](FIG4_15-TIE-2692.pdf){width=\"0.5\\columnwidth\"}\n\nThe data link network in Fig. \\[Consensus\\_Sys\\] is a directed graph where the inverters are the vertices and the directional data links are the edges. In this work, a not strongly connected directed network will be considered, so the data links shown in gray will be neglected. Thus, the adjacency matrix $A_g$ and the degree matrix $D_g$ of the directed graph presented in Fig. \\[Consensus\\_Sys\\] are:\n\n$$\\left[ A_g \\right] = \n\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}0&1&0\\\\\n                         1&0&1\\\\\n                         0&1&0   \\end{array} \\right] , \\quad \\left[ D_g \\right] = \n\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1&0&0\\\\\n                         0&2&0\\\\\n                         0&0&1   \\end{array} \\right] \n\\label{adjacency_degree_m}$$\n\nIt is possible to implement different types of consensus algorithm into the secondary control level. For example, to implement the active power sharing an average-consensus algorithm can be used. This kind of consensus can be represented by (\\[consensus\\_eq\\]) [@Rezasaber2004; @Rezasaber; @Linyu], where $x$ is the state vector of the system, $\\mathbf{L}$ is the Laplacian matrix of the graph defined by (\\[Laplacian\\_def\\]).\n\n$$\\dot{x}=-C(\\mathbf{D_g}-\\mathbf{A_g})x=-C\\mathbf{L}x\n\\label{consensus_eq}$$\n\n$$\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{D_g}-\\mathbf{A_g}.\n\\label{Laplacian_def}$$\n\nIn this case, the distributed control law can be represented by (\\[outcntr\\_law\\]), considering an unweighted graph, where $C$ is a constant called the diffusion constant, which affects the convergence rate [@Linyu].\n\n$$P_{refi} = - C\\int \\sum_{\\substack{j=1 \\\\ j\\neq i}}^{n} (P_{avi}-P_{avj})dt\n\\label{outcntr_law}$$\n\nThe consensus algorithm implemented using the distributed controller represented by (\\[outcntr\\_law\\]) is capable of keeping the equitable active power sharing in spite of load variation, but it does not guarantee the operation at the nominal frequency. Therefore, in order to meet both requirements, in this work the control law for the secondary control implemented in each inverter is described by (\\[scntr\\_law\\]), this corresponds to the distributed controller implemented in the multi-agent system represented by the graph in Fig. \\[Consensus\\_Sys\\], where $k_{pri}$ is the integral gain of the controller in each inverter.\n\n$$P_{refi} = - k_{pri}\\int \\sum_{\\substack{j=1 \\\\ j\\neq i}}^{n} (P_{refi}-P_{avj})dt\n\\label{scntr_law}$$\n\nThe terms to be included in the summation presented in (\\[scntr\\_law\\]) depend on the topology of the data link network, that is, the existence of an outgoing edge from vertex $j$, which is incident on vertex $i$, implying the term $(P_{refi}-P_{avj})$ in the summation. It is assumed that all vertex has at least one incoming edge, which implies that all distributed controllers have at least one term in the summation. Then, considering the data link network as the graph described by the green line edges (Fig. \\[Consensus\\_Sys\\]), the linearization of the control law shown in (\\[scntr\\_law\\]) is:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\nonumber \n\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\dot{\\Delta P_{ref1}}\\\\  \n                      \\dot{\\Delta P_{ref2}}\\\\ \n                      \\dot{\\Delta P_{ref3}} \\end{array} \\right] &=& - \n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} k_{pr1} &  0     &    0    \\\\  \n                           0     & k_{pr2}&    0    \\\\ \n                           0     &  0     &  k_{pr3} \\end{array} \\right]                       \n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}   1  &  0  &  0    \\\\  \n                           0  &  2  &  0    \\\\ \n                           0  &  0  &  1 \\end{array} \\right] %\\\\ & & \\nonumber %used for normalsize               \n\\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\Delta P_{ref1}\\\\  \n                       \\Delta P_{ref2}\\\\ \n                       \\Delta P_{ref3} \\end{array} \\right]                          \n \\\\ \n &+& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} k_{pr1} &   0    &    0    \\\\  \n                                0     & k_{pr2}&    0    \\\\ \n                                0     &   0    &  k_{pr3} \\end{array} \\right] \n     \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}   0  &  1  &  0    \\\\  \n                                1  &  0  &  1    \\\\ \n                                0  &  1  &  0 \\end{array} \\right] %\\\\ & & %used for normalsize       \n     \\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\Delta P_{av1}\\\\  \n                            \\Delta P_{av2}\\\\ \n                            \\Delta P_{av3} \\end{array} \\right]\n\\label{delta_cntr_law} \\end{aligned}$$\n\nor in its representative form:\n\n$$[ \\dot{\\Delta P_{refs}} ] = -[k_{prs}][D_g][ \\Delta P_{refs} ]+[k_{prs}][A_g][ \\Delta P_{avs}].\n\\label{sdelta_cntr_law}$$\n\nIf a distinct graph is considered with different edges from those highlighted in Fig. \\[Consensus\\_Sys\\], to obtain a new control law, it is necessary only to change the degree matrix $D_g$ and adjacency matrix $A_g$ in (\\[sdelta\\_cntr\\_law\\]). It is important to emphasize that no loop is considered in the network graph, that is, the term $P_{refi}-P_{avi}$ is not presented in the summation of (\\[scntr\\_law\\]). This would be an option for keeping the nominal frequency in case of only one inverter or vertex remaining in operation, but in fact, no consensus is necessary if only one vertex is presented, since the nominal frequency could be imposed by the controller. Thus, as the loops are not considered in simple graphs, they will not be considered here either.\n\nTime Delay on The Secondary Control {#sec_2control_delay}\n-----------------------------------\n\nEquation (\\[sdelta\\_cntr\\_law\\]) represents the distributed controller in each inverter if no time delay is present in the data communication link. However, in this work, a constant time delay $t_d$ will be considered in each data communication link represented by the edges on the network graph. Then, (\\[sdelta\\_cntr\\_law\\_td\\]) must replace (\\[sdelta\\_cntr\\_law\\]).\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\nonumber %equacao com quebra,\\nonumber p/numeracao unica e & & p/alinhamento\n[ \\dot{\\Delta P_{refs}}(t) ] &=& -[k_{prs}][D_g][ \\Delta P_{refs}(t) ] \\\\\n& & +[k_{prs}][A_g][ \\Delta P_{avs}(t-t_d)].\n\\label{sdelta_cntr_law_td}\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSubstituting (\\[sdelta\\_cntr\\_law\\_td\\]) in (\\[stateeqsys\\]), it is possible to eliminate the input derivative term in the small-signal model for the islanded microgrid under the primary level control.

Each node is composed of a three-phase inverter with the control scheme as presented in Section \\[sec:1\\]. The reader has to keep in mind that the inverter internal controllers are neglected in the proposed small-signal model. The value of transmission line impedance for the inverter 1 was considered twice the value of the impedance of the other inverters for increasing the degree of generalization.\n\n  [ Variable]{}                                     [ Value]{}           [ Unit]{}\n  ----------------------------------------- -------------------------- --------------\n  Inverter LC filter - inductor                       $1.8 $                $mH$\n  Inverter LC filter - capacitor                     $27.0 $              $\\mu H $\n  Load 1 = Load 2                                  $ 119 + j0 $          $ \\Omega$\n  Line transmission - inverter 1                 $ 0.2 + j1.131$         $ \\Omega$\n  Line transmission - inv. 2 and 3              $  0.1 + j0.566 $        $ \\Omega$\n  Measuring filter cut-off frequency                                   \n  $(\\omega_{f1}=\\omega_{f2}=\\omega_{f3})$           $31.4159 $             rad/s\n  Frequency droop coefficient                                          \n      $(k_{p1}=k_{p2}=k_{p3})$                      $ 0.0004$             rad/s/W\n  Voltage droop coefficient                                            \n      $(k_{v1}=k_{v2}=k_{v3})$                      $ 0.0005$              V/var\n  Freq. restoration integral gain                                      \n      $(k_{pr1}=k_{pr2}=k_{pr3})$                     $ 5  $                W/s\n  Voltage PR controller                                                \n     proportional gain $(k_{rv})$                     $0.06$                A/V\n     resonant gain $(k_{resv})$                       $40.0$               A/V/s\n  Current PR controller                                                \n     proportional gain $(k_{ri})$                     $10.0$                V/A\n     resonant gain $(k_{resi})$                       $50.0$               V/A/s\n  Virtual resistance $(R_v)$                          $1.5$              $ \\Omega$\n  Virtual inductance $(L_v)$                         $4    $                $mH$\n  Apparent power                                                       \n     inverter 1 $(P_1+jQ_1)$                     $ 442.5 - j9.7 $            VA\n     inverter 2 $(P_2+jQ_2)$                     $ 442.5 + j8.6 $            VA\n     inverter 3 $(P_2+jQ_2)$                     $ 442.5 + j8.6 $            VA\n  Inverter 1 output voltage $(\\vec{E_1})$       $ 230.0 \\angle 0$       V (rms), rad\n  Inverter 2 output voltage $(\\vec{E_2})$    $ 229.99 \\angle -0.0018$   V (rms), rad\n  Inverter 3 output voltage $(\\vec{E_3})$    $ 229.99 \\angle -0.0018$   V (rms), rad\n  Nominal frequency $(\\omega)$                      $ 314.159$             rad/s\n  Switching frequency                                 $ 10 $                kHz\n\n  : [System Parameters and Equilibrium Point]{}[]{data-label=\"tab_exem1\"}\n\nThe data communication links used in the simulations are represented by the highlighted edges shown in Fig. \\[Consensus\\_Sys\\]. The time delay in simulations were implemented using a pure delay block $e^{-t_d s}$.\n\nEach results' graph presents four curves identified as *Model*, *Sim1*, *Sim2* and *Exp* in the graph legend, which corresponds to the following results:\n\n*Model*\n\n:   This curve corresponds to the solution of the DDE, which is a linear time-invariant system with delay in state feedback. Since the respective DDE is a small-signal model, it provides the deviations $\\Delta X$, which must be added to the equilibrium point value to obtain the variable behaviour during the transient ($X=X_{eq} + \\Delta X$).\n\n*Sim1*\n\n:   This curve is a numerical solution of the nonlinear system provided by a circuit simulator. In this case, all control blocks presented in Fig.1 are implemented, except the internal controllers, the virtual impedances and the LC filters, that is, the inverter reference voltage is equal to the inverter output voltage, and thus each inverter is an ideal voltage source.\n\n*Sim2*\n\n:   This curve is a numerical solution of the nonlinear system. However, in this case, the proportional-resonant controllers, the virtual impedances and the LC output filters were included in the circuit simulator. The effect of the pulse width modulation was neglected.\n\n*Exp*\n\n:   This curve is an experimental result obtained from the lab prototype, as seen in Fig. \\[Lab\\_setup\\]. The inner loops, primary and secondary control loops were modelled in the Matlab/Simulink and then the respective code was programmed into a dSPACE 1006 to control the three Danfoss FC302 converters. The three-unit system was powered by a Regatron GSS DC power supply. Finally, the output power and frequency of the converters were locally monitored by the dSPACE Control Desk. The inverter switching frequency was $10 kHz$.\n\n![Laboratory Setup[]{data-label=\"Lab_setup\"}](FIG5_15-TIE-2692.pdf){width=\"0.9\\columnwidth\"}\n\nIn order to maintain the same comparison basis in our analysis and as the virtual impedance represents an element connected in series with the actual line impedance, both values were added to represent the inverter connection impedance to obtain the *Model* and *Sim1* results. This was due to the fact that the virtual impedance concept was only included in the inverter controllers for *Sim2* and *Exp* results.\n\nThe results correspond to a transient situation between two steady states, defined by *Load 1* and *Load 2* (see Table \\[tab\\_exem1\\]). Initially the system is considered as being in the steady state, as defined by the connection of *Load 1*. This situation implies a constant historical function for all states ($ \\Delta X(t)= \\phi (t)= constant, t \\in[-t_d,0] $ ) and a load flow is implemented to calculate this initial condition. Then, *Load 2* is connected in parallel with *Load 1* and the system moves to the new steady state, which consists of the equilibrium point shown in Table \\[tab\\_exem1\\]. A new load flow is implemented to calculate this equilibrium point, where the parameters are used to calculate the small-signal model constants.\n\nFig. \\[freq\\_result\\] shows the behavior of the frequency of the three inverters during the transient, considering two distinct values for the time delay $t_d$ in the data communication link. The frequencies were obtained by the small-signal model, by the simulations ( *Sim1=ideal inverters, Sim2= real inverters*), as well as by the experiment. The calculations for the model were obtained through the dde23 Matlab function. One notes there exists a perfect agreement between the model and simulation (*Sim1*), where the inverter internal dynamics is neglected. Even considering the inverter internal dynamics, the agreement between the model, simulation (*Sim2*) and the experimental result (*Exp*) is very good, which shows that the inverter internal dynamics does not affect the interaction between nodes significantly and it is reasonable therefore, to neglect this interaction in the stability studies of the microgrid.\n\nWhen the load is changed, the primary control responds fast and moves the frequency of the system in order to keep the system stable and to provide load sharing. The secondary control provides the frequency restoration to the nominal value as we can see in Fig. \\[freq\\_result\\]. At the time delay $t_d=200ms$, the system almost achieves the new equilibrium frequency, and then, even with this delay, the secondary control starts the frequency restoration.\n\n![Root locus computed with Matlab code from [@thesis_elias] and the number of Chebychev nodes $N=20$[]{data-label=\"Root_Locus\"}](FIG8_15-TIE-2692.pdf){width=\"0.7\\columnwidth\"}\n\nThe root locus plot of the system considering the time delay $t_d$ variation from 0 to 200 ms is presented in Fig. \\[Root\\_Locus\\], which is focused upon the rightmost eigenvalues. The finite set of eigenvalues represented by the blue stars corresponds to the system spectrum if no time delay is considered, then in this case, the system is represented by an ODE as shown by (\\[syswithout delay\\]), where the $\\phi(t_o)$ is the initial condition and the historical function is no longer necessary.\n\n$$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}\n \\Delta\\dot{X}(t) = \\big(\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{A_d} \\big) \\Delta X(t);  &t>0\\\\\n \\Delta X(t_o)= \\phi (t_o); &t_o = 0  \\end{array} \\right. \\label{syswithout delay}$$\n\nThis root locus in Fig.\\[Root\\_Locus\\] corresponds to a numerical approximation, as it is an arduous task to determine the exact values of eigenvalues in DDE systems, mainly in the case of the presented model where $A$ and $A_d$ do not commute, that is, they are not simultaneously triangularizable. An error analysis for this numerical approach is presented in [@thesis_elias] for a system with an analytical solution, then it is expected that the root locus presented in Fig. \\[Root\\_Locus\\] corresponds to a well-defined accuracy. It is noted that the system maintains stability in spite of the variation of the time delay over the considered range. As the large time delay in communication implies a low exponential decay in the system's answer, the low frequency modes move toward imaginary axis on the root locus graph, but they do not cross it.\n\nExtension of The Proposed Model {#Ext_model}\n===============================\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, a three-inverter system was considered for presenting the math developed for the proposed model and the respective validation by simulation and experimental results, as presented in Section \\[sec:2\\] and \\[sec\\_simula\\], respectively. The proposed model can be extended in a straightforward manner to represent a microgrid with more inverters connected. For each new inverter, the model order will be increased by 5.\n\nIn order to show an example of the model extension, in this Section, a twelve-inverter system was considered with the same droop gains presented in Table \\[tab\\_exem1\\]. In order to increase the degree of generalization, each inverter was connected to a distinct transmission line, with inductances in the range of $0.95$ to $3.6 mH$. Across all results presented in this Section, a communication time delay $t_d$ of $200 ms$ was considered.\n\nIn Fig. \\[Twelveinv\\_regnet\\_mod\\] the frequency of each inverter is shown during the frequency restoration process, when $Load2 (40 \\Omega)$ is connect in parallel with $Load1(40 \\Omega)$. This is the result of the respective $60th$ order model. In this case, a regular data communication network was used, that is, all edges in the respective twelve vertex graph are presented, which implies a fast convergence in the consensus algorithm.\n\n![Twelve-Inverter System Frequency - Model $t_d=200 ms$[]{data-label=\"Twelveinv_regnet_mod\"}](FIG9_15-TIE-2692.pdf){width=\"0.8\\columnwidth\"}\n\n Constant Time Delay and Packet Loss in a Communication System {#delay_packet}\n==============================================================\n\nIn practice, it can be expected that a digital communication system will be used for the communication among the units. In this case, besides measurement information, packets also carry control information, which typically includes sequence numbers and/or timestamps [@RTP; @User_Data_Protocol]. By means of buffering and inspecting sequence-numbers/timestamp information, one can insure that the receiver processes the packets received from its peers in the order that enforces equal delay on the links. This technique is commonly used in real-time communication systems, like PDH, SDH, VoIP, teleconferencing etc. Further, the buffer delay is simply incorporated in the total delay. In this sense, the delay used in the analysis in the paper could be considered as an upper limit of the total delay, made equal for all links by using standard communication techniques.\n\nA series of experiments conducted in our lab showed that, for an off-the shelf WiFi equipment, the duration of the packet containing measurements is markedly less than $1 ms$, and the packet generation rate is of the order $1-5 ms$, which includes the transition from receiving to transmitting state. In a scenario with ca. $10$ stations, all-to-all communication and scheduled access, this implies that the frequency of secondary control can be made of the order of $50-100 Hz$.\n\nIn order to evaluate the performance of the secondary control considering an actual communication link, the twelve-inverter system presented in Section \\[Ext\\_model\\] was simulated in the same transient situation. The sampling frequency of the secondary control was tuned to $50 Hz$, which is a rate that could be supported by off-the shelf equipment and considered communication setup. It was also incorporated a packet loss probability of $10^{-2}$, which can be assumed to hold for $2 Mb/s$ WiFi links in rural scenarios [@Barsocchi2007]. Fig. \\[Twelve\\_invs\\_w1\\_12\\_regnet\\_50Hz\\_Ploss\\] shows the angular frequency of each inverter of the twelve-inverter system in the scenario described above. Compared with the result presented in Section \\[Ext\\_model\\], Fig. \\[Twelveinv\\_regnet\\_mod\\], one observes a good agreement. This last result shows that the usage of a realistic communication system, including the techniques mentioned above, implies no significant difference in the system behavior.\n\n![Twelve-Inverter System Frequency - Simulation parameters: Communication Sampling Rate: 50 Hz; Packet loss probability: $10^{-2}$[]{data-label=\"Twelve_invs_w1_12_regnet_50Hz_Ploss\"}](FIG14_15-TIE-2692.pdf){width=\"0.8\\columnwidth\"}\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nThis work presented the small-signal analysis for a microgrid system using the droop control method in the primary control and a frequency restoration function in the secondary control, where the respective communication data link was submitted to a single and constant time delay.\n\nThe secondary control was implemented in a distributed mode, considering a consensus algorithm. The data network can be considered in different configurations, which can be easily set into the proposed small-signal model.\n\nThe proposed small-signal model allowed for the stability analysis of a given microgrid, and it was possible to conclude that a single and constant time delay in the communication data link does not cause instability over the presented system.\n\nIn short, this work presents a starting point for future research, since it shows a direction for dealing with time delays in the secondary control of microgrids when one considers more realistic data communication links. The assumption of a constant time delay is reasonable, even when an actual communication system is used. The typical sampling rate and the packet loss observed in these communication systems do not affect the performance of the secondary control in the studied microgrid.\n\n% Generated by IEEEtran.bst, version: 1.12 (2007/01/11)\n\n[10]{} \\[1\\][\\#1]{} url@samestyle \\[2\\][\\#2]{} \\[2\\][[l@\\#1=l@\\#1\\#2]{}]{}\n\nJ.

{"text": "Many have speculated about the political outcome of the young Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's policies and strategic choices which placed the country he rules in the current status since his take-over from his father seven years ago. In a tough neighborhood such as the Middle East, no single political choice can be perfect as the challenges facing every King or President in such a hot spot of the world can either mean the demise of his rule or threaten the delicate balance of the regional powers and bring further instability or the possibility of an all out regional war that can destabilize the world economy and lead to worldwide calamity.\n\nYet, in a world that has become a global village no one country can pursue its sole national interests without working through the web of international diplomacy to seek those mutual benefits and enhance cooperation among the regional parties to bring about peace and prosperity to all.\n\nBased on these premises, there is an urgent need for an overall political change to those policies which have endangered our beloved country and placed it in the uncompromising position against the international community which have led to the isolation of Syria from the West where the political, economic, social, and security interests of the country are now in great jeopardy.\n\nOn the regional level, if there is one thing the regime can do immediately to save it from further escalation with the West is to act on the Lebanese and the Iraqi fronts.\n\nSyria should move towards reconciliation with its most significant neighbor, Lebanon. Traditionally Lebanon has been and will always be the arena to which most opposing political forces in the region seem to choose to square out their differences or influences in the region. This does not exclude any single country in the region. Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Egypt and Syria all have vested interest in the Lebanese affairs, however, for Syria it's a matter of survival for the regime to be able to keep the government of its closest neighbor in its circle of political influence and maintain leverage over its internal affairs.\n\nYet we see the futility of those policies adopted by the regime in Syria on daily basis.\n\nIts support to radical Lebanese opposition groups such as Hezbullah and Fatah Al-Islam have placed it against the parliamentary majority and continues to direct suspicion towards it for the string of the assassinations of their members and the late Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Syria should respect the sovereignty of Lebanon and should cease its interference into its internal affairs. If the regime is confident of its innocence in the outcome of the international tribunal of the killing of the late prime minister then stretching a hand of reconciliation towards its most important neighbor and to its majority government would go a long way in establishing the first stepping stone on the road to regional stability. Yet the regime continues to jeopardize the security and stability of Lebanon and Syria by arming and supporting radical elements the likes of Hezbuallh and Fatah Al-Islam on the premises that such support would create the desired armed struggle amongst the various sectarian factions in Lebanon and would prevent the election of a new president and hopefully stop the international tribunal process.\n\nPolicies of such recklessness endanger not only Lebanon, but could bring disastrous consequences for the whole region. In fact, it would threaten the national security of Syria and the regime itself. By supporting such groups, the regime is undermining the international community desires through the UN adoption of Security Council Resolution 1559 and the democratic process that is taking hold in Lebanon.\n\nTherefore, cutting off its support to Hezballah and other Militant groups in Lebanon and adopting the Damascus-Beirut/Beirut-Damascus Declaration which was signed by over 300 intellectuals on both sides, the regime would find itself in a favorable position which could ease the tensions with the West on the Lebanese front and would reap multiple benefits.\n\nAs for Iraq, it's as simple as keeping a vigilant eye on its border and maintaining the lid on the activities of militant Islamists groups who found the road to Damascus to be the starting point to their new promised land. With all its security apparatus the regime can easily spot and apprehend potential individuals seeking jihad in Iraq. Arab young jihadists men with beards and traditional mustaches, passing through Damascus international airport and posing as visitors to the Qamishly district on the eastern border with Iraq can not be hard to detect by the exceptional security apparatus which the regime have empowered. If the press can find them and interview them and publish their profile on the pages of the WWW, is it conceivable that the regime is unable to do so? A simple step-up of security vigilance with documentation to follow its progress can go a long way in improving the relationship with the Iraqi government and the US and might open the door for monetary help needed for lifting the burden on the infrastructure which was caused by the influx of the Iraqi refugees into the country.\n\nHowever, all this is wishful thinking as this will never be applied or adopted by an authoritarian regime which seems to be more concerned with its own survival than regional peace and stability. In fact, without further and continuous pressure on its members from the international community for true changes to its core and the nature of its political structure, the regime will continue to use proxy groups to undermine any efforts by the international community to bring about peace, stability and democracy to the region.\n\nLeadership begins with a vision. When the entire world surrounding you seems to be ablaze you simply can not ignore the signs of the imminent danger to yourself and your country. Today, Syria is surrounded by chaos and danger and without a vision in the leadership the danger and chaos will soon be knocking at its doors.\n\nChange starts from within ... very true. The Arabs (including Syria) need to be honest about their not-so-great traits and beliefs and habits.\n\nBut this applies to both sides. Israel and the United States need to reconsider their use of savage force to promote their selfish interests. The past few years, they took the actions that led to the vast majority of killing innocent civilians on planet earth.\n\nIt takes two to Tango... and it happens simultaneously ... you can't ask the Arabs to start to tango alone ...\n\nAlex,\nThe Arabs are only doing themselves a favor by democratization. You think that holding millions of people hostage by dictatorial regimes is the way forward. You do not undertand that it is the interest of the Arabs to democratize. Just read the UN development reports.\n\nThe Arabs should democratize regardless of what the US or Israel do. You are posing conditions just to keep a dictator in power. Democratization is not a tango. It is a necessarry ingredient in any successful society and the Arabs need it for themselves, not for the US or for Israel.\n\nI agree with AnotherIsraeliGuy! isn't that ironic coming from an arab nationlists like my self? The future is open boarders, cultural identities, and free trade. Well planned democratization is the only way forward.\n\nIn the past 5 years, Syria is more open and if thius trend continues Syria will be the most democratic in 20 years.\n\n2) We discussed it before and you know in detail what I stand for. Borders will eventually go away, yes ... but not if this administration continue to create more borders by destroying larger countries in order to replace them with smaller emirates and Sheikdoms.\n\n3) Bashar beik, you don't know me. I am not the stereotype you have in mind. I blame \"it\" on others when others are to blame, and I blame \"it\" on the Syrian regime when the regime is to blame, and I blame \"it\" on the System (regime plus people plus neighbors ...) when the system is to blame.\n\nSo I am not blaming America and Israel for the regime's corruption for example. And I am not blaming the regime for the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis... if you are new school and courageous, you should be able to do both.\n\nBesides .. is Zenobia also \"old school\" .. she is from San Francisco. Is FADI \"old school\"? ... you would be very impressed if you get to know him and to know his achievements in high technology.\n\nYou know, Wassim's \"picture\" on his blog is \"NO\" in Arabic ... which was \"NO to the non-democratic elections in Syria\" !\n\nYet we have the delusional blind man trying to conclude that the reason Wassim is not a fan of Israel or of current American foreign policy was that Wassim is ... a supporter of dictatorship.\n\nWhen I invited Wassim the first time to write here, I was inviting a regime critic... which he is.\n\nSo .. we are not \"old school\" ... we are not Baathists .. we are not Antisemitic, we love America (the country).\n\nYou and I might think that we know the reasons for Syria's foreign policies and might speculate, theorize, rationalize or even, in your case, justify it to be the right or wrong choice. Yet, the facts on the ground in Syria are still the same, an authoritarian system which controls and monopolizes all political events to its advantage.\nThose advantages, sometimes seem to be the logical choice when the interests of the regime criss-cross the interests of the country.\nTo proud Syrians, as yourself my dear friend, and others here who seem to praise those alliances the regime have made, its natural to jump on the bandwaggon and cheer on the wise leadership of the young president. Sure why not, it falls into the old Arab Nationalism camp and fits like a glove. However, its still misguided to many other proud Syrians, like myself :-), and seem foolhardy. But the facts remain the same.\n\nAs for Zenobia and Fadi, I would love to know them both and invite them for dinner in lovely Miami, you too included. I'm sure we will all indulge ourselves in a challenging debate. Just make sure on making arrangment on staying for while, as I'm sure we would all agree to disagree.\n\nBashaar - You say that \"these Arab countries\" produced the 9/11 hijackers, but you've just been talking about Syria. The countries which produced the hijackers are Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Lebanon. The first three countries all have pro-American regimes. They host American military bases or personnel and concur with the US on Israel-Palestine and Iraq. Syria, on the other hand, has not yet exported any Wahhabi-nihilist violence. The fourth country was Lebanon, which you seem to consider to be almost uniformly anti-Syrian. I have to disagree with you here. The best we can say is that Lebanon, as ever, is profoundly divided as to its allegiances. Hizbullah is not a 'miltant group' we can write off as undemocratic. It represents the majority of Lebanese Shia and is crucial in Lebanese politics socially and economically as well as militarily. Whether it destabilises the country is obviously a political call. Depending on your politics you will judge its defence of Lebanon last summer to be a service to Lebanon and all the Arabs, pointing towards a potential long term deterrence of Israeli aggression, or a destabilisation. As for Fatah al-Islam, I have seen no evidence whatsoever that Syria is behind them. Seymour Hersh in the New Yorker, however, suggests convincigly that such groups are being funded by Saudi Arabia and the US's friends in Lebanon.\n\nTo chime in again on the 'democracy' debate initiated by AIG and countered very effectively by Alex, there is a lot of simplistic thinking going on here. It is entirely possible to support an aspect of a regime's policy without supporting the undemocratic practises of that regime. Equally, not every critic of American foreign policy is anti-American. I disagree with every American administration I can remember, and I do my best not to buy American products. I don't like the empire. But I love a lot of American books, music and films, the American constitution and Bill of Rights, and several American people.\n\nqunfuz,\nHizballah per se is not destabilizing Lebanon. They are an important group and should have a say in Lebanese politics. It is arming them by Syria and Iran that produces the destabilization. Don't try to confuse the issues.\n\nAnd do you use the same standards for the US as you use for Syria? Do you not buy Syrian products because you don't agree with the Syrian regime?\n\n\" Equally, not every critic of American foreign policy is anti-American. I disagree with every American administration I can remember, and I do my best not to buy American products. I donā??t like the empire. But I love a lot of American books, music and films, the American constitution and Bill of Rights, and several American people.\"\n\nLet me remind you of the United States Bill of Rights in a brief description as to what it contains which I quickly picked up off the net;\n\n\"Protecting the rights of all citizens, residents and visitors on United States territory. Among the enumerated rights these amendments guarantee are: the freedoms of speech, press, and religion; the people's right to keep and bear arms; the freedom of assembly; the freedom to petition; and the rights to be free of unreasonable search and seizure; cruel and unusual punishment; and compelled self-incrimination. The Bill of Rights also restricts Congress' power by prohibiting it from making any law respecting establishment of religion and by prohibiting the federal government from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\"\n\nIf you do truely believe in this, then your support for the current policies of the regime in Damascus and to the clerical regime in Iran contradicts your belief. The people who wrote those words envisioned a better world for their childern and grandchildren and grand-grand children which you currently find yourself in disagreement with.\n\nLoving America does not stop at its constitution and the Bill of Rights. America have held the moral benchmark for the universal dream for the past century and continues to be the choice for any immigrant looking for better life from around the globe. It stands as a living proof of humanity greatest triumph over tyrany and prejedice. This does not mean America is without faults, in a democratic system bad presidents can reach the office, yet they usually leave at the end of their terms and the system goes on.\nIf America current foreign policy for this administration seems to be shortsighted, it does not mean its evil or ill-intended.\nWhen I read your article I rememberd the slogans of the past 45 years we have been hearing in Syria such as \"American Imperial Hegemony and Israeli Zionist plans to control us, our land and turn us into their agents\", don't you get tired of repeating such vanity?\n\nNo one can argue with the fact that Hizballah is a \"militant\" group, that is trying to create a state within a state in Lebanon. When Naserallah vows never to \"lay-down his arms\" for the sake of Lebanon, how can you believe his motives are altruistic? While Hizballah is a true political force on the lebanese scene, yet it seeks to undermine the majority government in Lebanon on daily basis. It's valiant efforts during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon proved popular as with any other liberation movement that have fought to free its country from foreign invadors. But after the pull-out of the IDF, its stance against Lebanese national aspiration in setting up a strong government and an army that can defend Lebanon proves to be antithetical.\nIts terror tactics against opposition members in the past prevented criticism of it from the majority government for long period of time. Criticism of it did not surface 'till it committed the mistake that cost Lebanon its infrastructur and set the country back 20 years and left it at a political impass.\n\nAs for the country origin of the 19 hijackers, your point is well put yet my contention was it is an \"Arab\" ideology that produced such haterd and continues to do so to this day. The factors involved are countless and can not be simply listed here so I'll leave this for another debate.\n\nAmerica have held the moral benchmark for the universal dream for the past century and continues to be the choice for any immigrant looking for better life from around the globe.\n\nSadly, this administration is not exactly a good ambassador for the wonderful country they were elected to lead.\n\nDo you want to read this article by American Catholics who visited Syria?\n\nWe came back from 10 months in Damascus in mid-June and plan to return to Syria early in September. When we speak about Syria with small groups in homes or churches here these days, my wife always makes a suggestion: Let's start a movement to tow the Statue of Liberty from the harbor in New York City to Syria's Mediterranean seaport at Latakia. That's where it belongs if there's anything at all to this business about giving over \"your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.\"\n\nAll I am saying is\n\n1) It is not Black and White ... neither Syria, nor America are pure White or pure Black.\n\n2) Things are generally improving in Syria and generally deteriorating in the United States ... under this administration.\n\nDon't confuse my opposition to the regime as an endorcement of political sanctions against the people of Syria. I know what WE are and I know what we are capable of. I never argued the Syrian people capacities to mercy and peace. I'm surprise you bring such a quote or an article to my attention. What's the point?\n\nI agree with you its not black or white when it comes to politics in Syria or America, but its actually black or white when it comes to ideals such as freedom and democracy.\n\nAs for things improving in Syria, it depends on your prespective.\nSC just published great comments from readers of the Economist magazine article regarding the hike in the price of Gasoline. One of the commentators brings the author of the article attention to hike in the price of electricity too. I don't believe that guy IN Syria share your views.\n\n1) I think it is clear why I linked the article ... the regime in Syria did not close Syria's borders to any refugee .... over two millions (Iraqis and Lebanese) found safety in Syria lately ... This administration which started and supported and sustained two unnecessary wars (Iraq and Lebanon) not only caused the killing of hundreds of thousands ... but refused to take refugees!\n\nLately ... Syria is much more moral, regardless of America's usual moral advantages of \"freedom, Liberty, and Democracy\" ... which are not in good shape lately, thanks to this administration.\n\n2) You can conclude whatever you want from any subset of comments that you feel prove your point ... but ... I assume as a republican American who found Mr. Cheney to be not too bad (as you told me at SC) .. I assume that you are not a socialist ... or are you? ... you want Syria to continue to subsidize electricity and Gasoline of not?\n\nIt does not look good when you criticize the regime if they decide to go with option A or its inverse, option B ...\n\nBashaar - if you visit my blog you'll find that I am deeply concerned with the internal Arab malaise that has given rise to Wahhabi-nihilism and other problems. You'll also find that I am critical of the Syrian regime's undemocratic aspects. I think the Bill of Rights is an important document that should be read and considered by the people of every country. Let me say it again as clearly as I can: I Want More Rights For Citizens in Syria. Here, however, we have been debating Syria's foreign policy. I believe that Syrian foreign policy, in the main, is far more in tune with public opinion and the principles of law than the foreign policy of the American clients in the region. This is DESPITE Syria's internal failings, which are obvious. As for America, I think you are very naive if you believe that America is anything other than a republic which has transformed into an empire. The Bill of Rights has noit been realised in America, and neither is America anything approaching a 'moral benchmark.' The American lack of democracy is something I will write about at greater length sometime on my blog. Have you read, for instance, Gore Vidal, who writes passionately on the failings of the American democracy, its transformation into an unrepresentative corporate empire, from a patriotic conservative viewpoint.\n\nAIG,\nwhat if...the foreign policy isn't helping. what if it is bad?\nin my own article, i didn't argue about whether it is ultimately good or not. I argued that Syria has no choice, effectively, given the positions that America has taken.\nbut lets suppose you are correct for a moment.\nEven so, there is just no denying that the Syrian government's position is in line with the sentiment of the majority of the public.\nIf you were here, you would get it, you would see it.\nFirst of all, there are pictures of the 'hero' Nasrallah...hanging in small stores and shops...allllll over syria. And i am not just talking about in the city.\nHezballah is overwhelmingly regarded as heroes. Hamas, i think a little less revered probably because there is nothing impressive about there organizational skills (in fact that is a travesty....so...)but...still Hamas is supported. Nobody is yelling to get the Hamas members out of the country.\n\nNext, a little word about my personal experiences. I have had many unpleasant moments, a couple where i was even a little bit frightened.... in small food shops...and taxis... where after i answered the inevitable question of where i am from... \"american....\".... i am bombarded with words.... like \"George Bush\" ..\"Condolezza Rice\".... 'criminals\"..... 'democracy!...\"... yelling about the actions of america.... and then a few words of fury about Israel controlling the United States congress.\n\nI mean, this has happened many times. And these are shop keepers and taxi blokes. Not regime figures....and mafia men. Ignorant? yes, probably.....but ....\nit is not amazing that this is what people scream about.\nSyrians really really hate Condi Rice and George Bush. these are their most hated people.\nso,... you know... you can tell me now...how those posters i see all over the place are put there by gun toting security officers spreading propaganda store to store....forcing people to put decals on their cars....\ni can't say i know the full truth.....all i can tell you is what i see....and i know it is a complicated relationship between the people and leaders. Impure, indeed.\n\nnonetheless, it is at least a follie a deux between the people and their leaders regarding the agreed upon enemies and heroes, regardless of what you or other outsiders would like to be the reality that makes sense to us.\n\nand ps,\njust so you know.....usually those shopkeepers who launch a tirade in my direction after i tell them i am American....and they go on an on ...about the crimes of the USA....\nat the end...most then take a pause, and tell me how much they like the American people in general...and speak to me in this gentle voice about how welcome i am to Syria...\nit is very amusing...\n\nZenobia,\nOne of the episodes that I find most enlightning about the relation between the Arab masses and the dictators is Nasser's \"resignation\" after the Six Day War and how the \"masses\" forced him to reconsider his position. You should take a hard look at it. It is all a well orchestrated sham that Arab dictators have become experts at. The \"masses\" play along because they really have no choice and the media is so one sided.\n\nLet me write in Tishrin for one month and you will see how public opinion in Syria changes (maybe I'll need a few more months :))\n\nToday, Syrians do not read Teshreen ... I told you that three ties so far .. do you understand it? ... do you think I am lying? .. SYRIANS READ EVERYTHING ... they make fun of the official newscast on Syrian television.\n\nThey have been properly enlightened ... they won't change if you offer them your wonderful opinions... President Bush did a \"good\" job trying to communicate with Syrians ... and Syrians understood very well his intentions.\n\nI know you hate to accept it but .. after reading the New York times, Haaretz, hostile Saudi-owned Lebanese satellite stations ... most Syrians, like Zenobia is confirming to you ... like Bahsar, Love Nasrallah, dislike the Syrian regime, and ... HATE your heroes ... The leaders of American and Israel... and Zenobia forgot .. Syrians hate the Lebanese crooks to whom America is trying to \"give\" the presidency ... by force, threats , international intimidation, and special presidential directives from the office of President Bush...\n\nMaybe we should ask them the same question you asked about Bashar: If America is so sure THEY (the M14 group) are really the Lebanese majority .. why are they afraid from new elections? ... just like you have in Israel when a government is clearly not functioning anymore ... you call early elections.\n\nAny idea why Syrians loved America when Presidents Clinton, and Bush Sr. were in charge? ... could it be that ... this mad administration is the reason behind most of the negativity?\n\nThe potential Good news is that there is a good chance (not guaranteed) that the net administration will be much more positive. Hillary already said that her husband would be her Middle East envoy .. he said that he thinks peace between Syria and Israel can be achieved in 30 minutes.\n\nAt least there is some hope there that Syrians would love an American democrat more than Nasrallah ...\n\nOtherwise ... don't worry about trying to make Syrians hear alternate points of view ... if that had any chance of success you wouldn't have had the early termination of the P.R.. mission of Karen Hughes and Dina Powell... both of them came back realizing that America has no hope of becoming popular in the Middle East without a change in actual policies.\n\nAlex,\nAmerica was NEVER popular with Syrians. All adminstrations were considered as doing Israel's bidding. You are not fooling anybody.\nA huge percentage of Syrians do not know English so your claims about them being informed are ridiculous (I found the part about the NY times extremely amusing). All the time you think of Syrians as the Christian and Alawite click that you are part of but you personally are not a typical Syrian which is a poor Sunni farmer.\n\nYou comment above was 70% insults and 30% opinion, I will not remove it because it had some opinion that I want to answer but as I explained many times before, from now on every single accusation you make, personal attack, or insult, I will remove your comments.\n\nWhy? ... because I want to go back to positive tone. At the beginning I tried to interest you in a more positive discussion, but it seems you are not compatible with positivity.\n\nSyrians also watch Almustaqbal ... Hariri's TV station that reminds viewers everyday that the Syrian regime is a murderous group of thugs ..etc... this is sounds exactly like you. So you really don't need to go there and lecture Syrians.\n\nSyrians have the internet ... they can read Haaretz, they can check the website of Al-Arabiya (owned by Saudi Arabia) ... Aljazeera (Qatar) ... Jordanian .. Egyptian sites .. ALL IN ARABIC ...\n\nYou get the picture? .. sorry if that takes away from the amusing part (the English New York Times) ...\n\nFor your info ... most of my friends are Sunni Syrians .. not Christians and not Alawites. I just spoke for an hour with Majhool ... a Sunni who is not a big fan of the regime. I am friends with everyone ... and I listen to their stories and opinions... and I learn.\n\nYou always talk confidently about us Syrians ... Are you friends with as many Syrians as I am? do you listen to them with an open mind?\n\nAnd if you really want to know ... I am also lucky to have Alawites, Druze, Sufis, Ismaelis, Freemasons, Opus Dei, Kabbalah among my friends... many of them are quite advanced in their groups.\n\nI know things you will probably never know or understand about the Middle East.\n\nAnd finally ... you asked me who am I fooling?! ... I don't know. You tell me. Why do I need to fool anyone? can you explain? ... will I make a million dollars if I fool you? ... will Bashar call me and congratulate me for convincing some \"AIG\" that Syrians sometimes are capable of not hating America?\n\nBut there are exceptions ... Syrians respected George Bush Sr. a lot ... When his son ran for office in 2000 ... all my Syrian friends, including me, were pro George Bush ... we all hoped he would finish the peace process that his father started.\n\nSyria, and the whole world will fall in love with America again if the next administration is more reasonable and peaceful ...\n\nthats, funny. i have a cousin (Syrian born but now an american citizen by marriage) who told me he actually voted for GB jr because he believed that he would be like his father.\nand he and his friends were sooo upset...when the reality was nothing like that.\ni was quite surprised to hear how many Syrians were big fans of George Bush Sr.\n\nanyhow i don't think Syrians read the NYTimes. they think NY is the haven of the Jewish conspiracy!.... sadly.\nbut....\nall the rest Alex said i agree with. I believe....from the TVs i see going ALL the time in Syria.... many you see from the street.... shops and police guard houses all over the place...and homes i have been in....\nthey watch LBC...and lebanese stations. they watch news from the gulf stations. and maybe some people watch the two meager Syrian stations sometimes...for celebrity stuff...but hardly at all for news.\nand young people are looking at the internet. they dont' read as much news though.\n\nyou would be surprised how many people speak English in Syria now. It is nothing like twenty years ago....the numbers have grown exponentially. the level of speaking is very poor....and i am not sure if they can read news adequately... but hey they have seen CNN.\neverybody knows.... of Fox TV....they know what is being said about them and their government.\n\nA small percentage of Syrians are connected to the Internet. They read Ha'aretz? Are you sure it is not censored? They censored this site but they don't censor Ha'aretz?\n\nAs usual you speak in generalities because there are no statistics no official numbers and no way to get them. There is no real debate in syria about the internal and foreign situation. There is only fear. When there is real debate we will know what Syrians really think. You think LBC and the Gulf channels give a complete picture and enough information? Of course not. The Syrians need to to see an Israeli debating a Syrian on television. When will that happen?\n\nI was out for a few days and I just got back to reading all the comments. Iā??m surprised you are still at it with AIG! I believe you both have good points but refuse to admit the obvious.\n\nNow back to your last comment to me;\n\nā??2) You can conclude whatever you want from any subset of comments that you feel prove your point ā?¦ but ā?¦ I assume as a republican American who found Mr. Cheney to be not too bad (as you told me at SC) .. I assume that you are not a socialist ā?¦ or are you? ā?¦ you want Syria to continue to subsidize electricity and Gasoline of not?\nIt does not look good when you criticize the regime if they decide to go with option A or its inverse, option B ā?¦ā?\n\nDonā??t you find a contradiction in your statement, your advocate putting off democracy project in Syria for later times and accept the regime for now for the sake of stability and security, yet you seem here to support lifting subsidies on Gas and Electricity which can literally bring on popular disenchantment, chaos, and possibly street demonstrations that would threaten the security and stability which you seem to be so concerned with!\nOne more thing, you assumed wrong, and Iā??m a registered Democrat and have been since I became full fledged American citizen. Never voted Republican and never will.\nAhlan Wassahla ļ?\n\noh my goodness ...AIG....why do you keep sounding like you know what goes on here. you have some ideas....that are not completely untrue...but they are exaggerated and so concrete, completely lacking in any nuance.\n\ni mean....i have lots of ideas about what goes on in Israel.. definitely...it is easier to say things about a place in terms of its professed politics.... but I would never in a million years... start making big statements about what is going on inside Israelis... if I haven't even been there to see....or spend some time.\nit is all speculation. and whats even weirder...is that you keep asserting your idea.... even though their are probably a lot of people who could say with more experiences and more accuracy what the situation is.\n\nI mean if you wanted to talk about and describe Israeli society at some point or in some context, I would be all ears... it wouldn't occur to me to lecture you on what I know!...who hasn't even been there..... it is absurd.\n\nZenobia,\nYou can easily visit Israel and go where ever you like and speak to whomever you want without being followed or harrassed. There are realible statistics. There are computerized databases. There are hunderds of documentaries. Israeli society is an open book. The bad and the good are there for all to see.\n\nWe agree that this is not the case with Syria. I do not know what exactly Syrians think, but I am 100% that they are humans like anybody else and are not less talented or able than any other humans. Maybe I am really stubborn but I will not accept that Syrians are timid and resist change as their nature and that this will take years and years to change. I believe that once democratization takes place, you will see a very quick acceptance. Ask yourself, do Syrians that move to the US, and encounter huge amounts of change, do these Syrians require years of adjustment in general? I am sure they don't.\n\nSo you are a democrat! ....You must be the only Democrat who had something positive to say about Mr. Cheney.\n\nIf I were an American, I would not be a democrat .. and I would not be a republican. I would be an independent.\n\nNow ... back to your observation that i was not consistent:\n\nDonā??t you find a contradiction in your statement, your advocate putting off democracy project in Syria for later times and accept the regime for now for the sake of stability and security, yet you seem here to support lifting subsidies on Gas and Electricity which can literally bring on popular disenchantment, chaos, and possibly street demonstrations that would threaten the security and stability which you seem to be so concerned with!\n\nHmmm ... who said I support lifting subsidies?\n\nI support the gradual lifting of these subsidies ... lifting subsidies over 5 to 10 years.\n\nYou might want to ask Ehsani how much I argued with him regarding his ideas for immediate widespread economic reforms... including lifting subsidies.\n\nDon't worry .. I was living in Egypt when Sadat lifted the subsidies on bread and witnessed those demonstrations in the streets of Cairo.", "category": "current_affairs_government_administration"}
{"text": "News\n\nSony looks to revive the Playstation network\n\nA white Sony Playstation 4 is on display at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo, known as E3, in Los Angeles, California on June 11, 2014. Photo: Reuters/Kevork Djansezian\n\nBy Reiji Murai\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Sony Corp is hammering out plans to rise from the ashes of nearly $10 billion lost in six years by building a future around its last consumer electronics blockbuster - the PlayStation.\n\nSony plans to reposition the video console warhorse as a hub for a network of streamed services, according to three senior officials, offering social media, movies and music as well as games. The executives spoke to Reuters on condition they not be named because the matters are still in early stages of discussion.\n\nThe plans to coax more revenue from the PlayStation's network of users are being developed by a new breed of managers brought in by Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai. Analysts say if Sony gets it right, the game and network business could earn about $1 billion in the fiscal year from April 2016 - making it the most profitable part of the company bar a financial services unit.\n\n\"Network services have been a long-running issue for Sony,\" said Atsushi Osanai, associate professor at Waseda University's business school. It's a field Apple Inc has dominated with iTunes, while established movie and music services like Netflix Inc and Spotify are expanding fast.\n\n\"In the past there was a time when they (Sony) were all over the place and went after everything, but zeroing in first on game users is effective,\" said Osanai. The company's next progress report will come with its first-quarter earnings on July 31.\n\nAt 200 billion yen ($1.96 billion) last fiscal year, some 90 percent of it from games, Sony Entertainment Network's revenue is small compared with the 5 trillion yen at the company's broader electronics business. The division lost 10 billion yen last year and more losses are expected this year as it spends on servers and systems for a surge in users, but the executives - and analysts - expect it to ramp up quickly after that to double-digit margins.\n\nThe new thinking is far from Sony's first effort to kickstart a revival. Yet the company that was once the symbol of Japan's technology prowess has often failed in attempts to deliver innovative hits to match successes of old, like the Walkman music player.\n\nThe managers lining up Sony's new strategy know a PlayStation network won't fix mainstream loss-making businesses, like its TV division - \"a grim electronics portfolio\", according to brokerage Jefferies. It's also not the first time Sony has tried to develop networked content services.\n\nBut under plain-speaking Kenichiro Yoshida, a former head of Sony's Internet services unit now leading the charge as chief financial officer since April, managers believe focusing on PlayStation to develop a network is potentially Sony's best chance of securing a money-making springboard for revival.\n\n\"These are crucial assets that offer the greatest potential upside,\" said one of the senior officials.\n\nGAME ON\n\nThe network's base of 52 million active users is dwarfed by Apple's iTunes with over 800 million, and now just about the same size as fast-growing Netflix. But Sony Entertainment Network's peg to a hit piece of hardware with a potentially captive audience can give the service a future edge, executives say.\n\nYoshida, 54, knows networks so far have been a black spot for Sony. A PlayStation security breach in 2011 was a major setback to its plans at the time for a looser network that was designed to allow a range of Sony devices to be connected.\n\nThe CFO's message to executives is that things must change. \"What's made it tough for Sony in electronics is that we were never able to take the lead role in the networking era,\" Yoshida told a gathering of about 500 managers earlier this year, according to a person who attended the meeting.\n\nWhile the network plans take shape, this year Yoshida is also overseeing restructuring across the company. Sony is axing thousands of white-collar jobs, has ditched the Vaio personal computer brand, and has placed the TV business in a separate subsidiary - to fend for itself.\n\nHigh-tech components such as image sensors and batteries for smartphones, and next-generation consumer gadgets such as wearables, have been identified by Sony managers as key potential areas of hardware growth.\n\n\"Game and network services are a core part of Sony's electronics and we are currently strengthening our network services by expanding sales of the PlayStation 4 in a bid to raise revenue,\" said Mami Imada, Sony's general manager of public relations, asked to comment on future strategy for this article.\n\nThe latest iteration of the now 20-year-old console has outsold rivals easily, attracting committed gamers rather than the casual game playing audience that is migrating to smartphones and other mobile devices.\n\nEven as Sony plans to extend the PlayStation's role, games are still driving the network services division forward, accounting for 90 percent of revenue. From July 31, Sony is launching a streaming game service, PS Now, the first ever for a console game maker, in the United States.\n\nSony has sold 8.7 million PlayStation 4s against 5 million Microsoft Corp Xbox Ones as of July 19, according to market research firm VGChartz. Nintendo Ltd's Wii U console, released a year earlier than its rivals, also trails with sales of 6.7 million.", "category": "game"}
{"text": "Transport of goods is becoming more and more automated. Automatic scanning of products is resulting in information being transferred over world-wide networks. But verifying the product's integrity and authenticity is still often subject to manual steps of physical and/or optical inspection.\nSophisticated fraud, manipulation and counterfeiting of products pose a major challenge to brand owners, logistics organizations and customers, where the integrity of products and shipments are difficult to verify.\nFurther, there is a subjective part in verifying a product's integrity and authenticity, especially when performed remotely. If a brand owner wants to verify a product's authenticity without having access to the product physically, it has to be a certain level of trust between the parties.\nA tamper evident packaging is described in WO 2004/078787, where embedded sensors can detect if the packaging has been tampered with. This conventional approach further describes methods to verify the product's authenticity in a remote scenario. However, this conventional approach is limited to applications where a fixed-sized packaging is used, since the sensors are embedded in the packaging material. In applications where the shipment is not originally packed in the tamper evident packaging and where repacking of the shipment is not feasible or practicable, this solution is of less use.\nIn some applications, a small label is used to seal a specific part of a product. If the product has been compromised, the seal is broken. Again, such solutions are generally limited to optical inspection only.\nRecent developments in the field of Automatic Identification (AutoID) and associated services have created an increasing demand for radio frequency tags, known as RFID tags. By embedding an electronic label onto a product, the product can be identified and optional additional data stored in the label, by radio frequency interrogation. However, problems with such labels generally are that they provide limited level of confidence in terms of product authenticity, as the tags can be interrogated by anyone and the label and its contents can be counterfeited itself. Also, the tags do not provide any tamper evidence. Some solutions have been presented, where an RFID tag is applied in a way, where it is very difficult to remove it without physically destroying the tag, thereby making the tag unreadable. An unreadable tag would require manual inspection, which then in theory would make a tamper event evident. However, when there has been a tamper event it is naturally of interest to understand which identity the tampered shipment has and a system where the identity is destroyed would then require an additional identity backup system.\nA different approach is disclosed in patent application WO 02/077939, where a label is prepared with a frangible conductive trace, which is designed to break if the label is damaged or an attempt has been made to remove it. However, finding the right balance between an easily broken circuit and a low risk of false alarms is somewhat difficult. Further, a detection circuit without continuous monitoring can be repaired by an opponent after a tamper event, which leaves the event undetected.\nAnother problem with the presently known solutions concerns the removal of even very strong and advanced adhesive labels by use of specialized solvents, in liquid- or vapour form. Combined means of heating and/or freezing, the adhesive also affect the strength of the bond and the tack of the adhesive.\nIt would therefore be desired to have a solution addressing the above mentioned issues and weaknesses to allow an objective verification of a product's integrity and authenticity in a remote scenario, preferably with connection to a unique product identifier. Further desirable would be to make this solution compatible with the evolving RFID infrastructure.", "category": "transportation"}
{"text": "Waterslide amusement devices have been popular for decades. In the simplest waterslide, a rider climbs a stairwell located in a tower. The rider then enters an entrance of the waterslide and is propelled by gravity along the waterslide until splashing into a pool located at an end of the waterslide. Water flows down the waterslide along with the rider to decrease friction and enhance the entertainment value of the ride. Thus, a rider coasts along a slippery surface from a higher elevation to a lower elevation, either in a straight line path or on a path that includes curves. One variation of this approach has been to introduce undulations into the waterslide, so that the rider is propelled by gravity along a rollercoaster-like progression of downhill and uphill runs.\nThe \"rider\" can be an individual using the waterslide amusement device, for example in a sitting or prone position, or one or more persons using the waterslide amusement device on a mat, raft, tube or other conveyance device designed to slide on the waterslide surface.\nWaterslide amusement devices that rely solely or primarily on gravity to propel the rider are expensive to manufacture and construct because they typically require the construction of a large, high tower, and an intricate elevated framework for supporting the waterslide high above the ground. One solution to this problem has been to provide a lift mechanism to raise a rider to a starting height, eliminating the need for the rider to climb stairs to ascend the tower. However, such lift mechanisms generally convey the rider at a constant speed, and add no excitement to the rider's experience. Some waterslide amusement devices include one or more variable speed conveyor belts interfaced with the slide for transporting the rider along uphill sections of the slide path (for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,371,183). The conveyor system may further include a control system having a sensor for sensing the speed of the rider. The control system can be adapted to control the speed of the variable speed conveyor belt based upon the sensed speed of the rider.\nAnother approach has been to propel the rider up an inclined waterslide surface or accelerate the rider along downhill and uphill segments of the slide using water jets, rather than have the rider propelled by gravity alone (for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,213,547). A series of water jets may be used to direct high-pressure water along the waterslide surface, and in the process propel the rider along the slide path. Although effective, this approach has certain limitations. If the force of the jets is too low then riders may only be conveyed a short distance along the slide path. If the jets are too powerful and the rider moving too slowly, then the rider may experience a jerky ride. Furthermore, if the force of the water jets propelling the rider is not adjusted then riders of different weights may be accelerated along the waterslide for different distances at different speeds and with different consequences for the rider's experience. Lighter riders may be propelled up a hill too far or too forcefully, at unsafe or undesirably high speeds. Heavier riders may move too slowly to provide sufficient excitement, or even too slowly to reach the crest of a hill. If the rider fails to reach the crest, the rider may slide backwards into the valley between uphill and downhill segments, creating a safety hazard, and requiring intervention to complete or terminate the ride.\nSome waterslide amusement devices use rider speed traps, in which the speed of the rider is measured by timing the rider's travel along a slide path between two or more photocells. In some cases, the water volume and flow rate of the water jets are adjusted based on the measured speed of the rider. One problem with this method is that the operation of the photocells can be adversely affected by spray, and can be triggered by other extraneous motion in addition to the passage of the rider. False readings from the photocells can generate errors in the control system and can constitute a safety hazard. Also, measurement of rider speed at a particular location is not necessarily a reliable determinant of the force that will need to be applied to the rider in order for the rider to safely negotiate a downstream portion or feature of the slide path with an appropriate degree of excitement.\nThe present approach takes into account the inertia of the rider.", "category": "tourism_geography"}
{"text": "The present invention relates to fire escape devices, and more particularly to a fire escape device for use in escaping from a structure through the screen of a screened-in area.\nApartment houses, such as the low rise condominiums on the West Coast of Florida, are frequently provided with screened-in terraces and windows to protect tenants from the flying insects prevalent in the area. The only means of egress from such an apartment, other than the single front door, may be the screened-in terrace or window. In the event of a fire which precludes egress through the front door, the only way for the occupant to reach safety (whether that be the ground or the apartment immediately below) may be by way of the terrace or window. While the window screens are typically at least partially removable, the size and location of the window may render it unsuitable as an egress, especially for the elderly or handicapped. On the other hand, the larger and more accessible terraces are typically provided with fixed screens which are not easily removed, certainly not in the presence of an adjacent fire with the attendant smoke interfering with clear vision, calm breathing and deliberative minds.\nThus even those few who are foresighted enough to provide themselves with some sort of emergency fire escape means (for example, ropes, ladders, or the like), so that they can escape from the apartment by going down the outside of the building, may find themselves stymied by the presence of a screen which interferes with their access to the outside of the building via the terrace or window. Cutting means (such as a knife) in the kitchen or tool chest may not be sufficient where the flames, smoke or sheer panic render these locations as a practical matter unavailable. Especially where the fire is well developed before the tenant becomes aware of it, thereby may be simply be insufficient time for a special trip to the kitchen or the tool box prior to bringing the fire escape means into play.\nFor those fortunate enough to live on the lower floors, only a relatively short length of fire escape means (e.g., ladder or rope) is required in order to reach the safety of the ground. For those living on the upper floors, a comparatively short length of fire escape means might enable them to reach one or more apartments immediately below them, but the presence of a screen would again stand between them and safety unless the cutting means were also available to breach the screen of the apartments below.\nAccordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a fire escape device for use in escaping from a structure through the screen of a screened-in area.\nAnother object of is to provide such device which enables a fire escape means (such as a rope) and a screen cutting means (such as a knife) to be stored in handy proximity and brought to the screen of a screened-in area together.\nA further object is to provide such a device wherein the screen cutting knife is accessible for use in cutting the screen of a screened-in area belonging to an apartment below.\nIt is another object of the present invention to provide such a device which is of sturdy, rugged and economical construction.", "category": "fire_safety_food_safety"}
{"text": "Data are available at <>.\n\nIntroduction {#sec001}\n============\n\nDuring fruit ripening, a number of morphological and physiological changes occur converting a green immature fruit into a more attractive to consumers with several organoleptic properties and full ripen fruit. Particularly, an increasing amount of volatile compounds can be observed, which is responsible of the characteristic aroma of any fruit \\[[@pone.0153057.ref001]\\]. The specific aroma of each fruit is generated by the accumulation of a pool of volatile compounds, where the most abundant in *Fragaria* genus are esters compounds \\[[@pone.0153057.ref002],[@pone.0153057.ref003]\\].\n\nEsters are generated by an esterification reaction, between an acyl-CoA and one alcohol molecule, which is catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol acyltransferase (AAT; EC 2.3.1.84). Acyl-CoA-dependent AATs have been classified into the BAHD superfamily that is composed by several acyltransferases involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites like esters, anthocyanins, phytoalexins, etc \\[[@pone.0153057.ref004],[@pone.0153057.ref005]\\]. Different combinations of alcohols and acyl-CoA generate a wide range of esters on different types of fruits \\[[@pone.0153057.ref006]--[@pone.0153057.ref010]\\]. In general, plant AATs are monomeric enzymes with a molecular mass between 48 to 55 kDa \\[[@pone.0153057.ref001],[@pone.0153057.ref005]\\]. These enzymes are cytosolic because they do not present destination sequences to organelles or to excretion's route, moreover, it has been proved that their activities are strictly related to the presence of a Histidine residue in the conserved HXXXD motif \\[[@pone.0153057.ref011]\\].\n\nSequence analysis of members of the BAHD superfamily shows that a high divergence exists between them (less than 30% of identity), where conserved regions are limited to few structural motifs. Two of those conserved structural motifs are HXXXD and DFGWG, located at the protein center and near to the carboxylic termini, respectively. The HXXXD motif is highly conserved in both higher plants and yeasts. The substitution of Histidine and Aspartic residues by Alanine in this motif causes loss of the catalytic activity in VpAAT1 \\[[@pone.0153057.ref012]\\] and vinorine synthase \\[[@pone.0153057.ref011]\\], other members of the BAHD superfamily. It is important to point out that members of the BAHD type III family possess the HXXXDG motif that is located in the center of the protein. This motif has been recognized to be involved in the acetyl group transfer mechanism that is catalyzed by a base, as it has been experimentally proved in type III members of proteins like chloramphenicol acetyltransferases (CAT), in which the predominant mechanism goes through a ternary complex \\[[@pone.0153057.ref013]\\]. The same experimental evidence arose for vinorine synthase, another member of the subfamily III, whose crystallographic structure and biochemical analysis allowed to propose the formation of the abovementioned ternary complex \\[[@pone.0153057.ref014]\\]. Interestingly, FaAAT1 as well as vinorine synthase are involved in the production of volatile compounds in flowers and fruits \\[[@pone.0153057.ref005]\\].\n\nThe other highly conserved structural motif in this BAHD superfamily is DFGWG, which seems to be involved in maintenance of enzyme structure. To date, there is only one crystal structure from vinorine synthase (PDB: 2BGH), a member of the BAHD superfamily. Vinorine synthase, an acetyl transferase from *Rauvolfia serpentine* contains two domains connected by a connector loop \\[[@pone.0153057.ref014]\\]. According to this crystal structure a solvent channel is located in the middle of the protein, between both protein domains, going through the entire protein and allowing the substrates to reach the catalytic motif that is located in the center of solvent channel \\[[@pone.0153057.ref014]\\].\n\nExperimental data, on the specificity of AATs enzymes to different substrates, indicate that there are differences in binding affinities to both substrates (acyl-CoA and alcohols) which define the characteristic ester pattern of each fruit species \\[[@pone.0153057.ref005],[@pone.0153057.ref015],[@pone.0153057.ref016]\\]. On the other hand, previous experimental studies in *F*. *x Anannasa* AAT (SAAT) show that octanol acetate is the main ester found in higher concentrations, followed by hexanol acetate \\[[@pone.0153057.ref001]\\]. Interestingly, it was reported that SAAT is less specific for alcohols with shorter aliphatic chains \\[[@pone.0153057.ref001]\\].\n\nSome studies related to the catalytic activity of BAHD members have been done in the last decade. According to Suzuki *et al*. \\[[@pone.0153057.ref009]\\]. Ss5MaT1 forms a ternary complex between the two substrates and residue His167. This residue acts as a general base which in turn deprotonates the alcohol making it unstable and capable to perform a nucleophilic attack on the acyl-CoA forming the final ester product. The same finding was reported recently in mountain papaya fruit \\[[@pone.0153057.ref012]\\].\n\nMolecular homology models have been obtained from gene sequences of different organisms aiming to understand the structure and interaction of AAT with different substrates \\[[@pone.0153057.ref017]--[@pone.0153057.ref019]\\]. On those analyses the authors found a very conservative folding between different AAT, where substrates interact with the AAT through the solvent channel inside the protein, specifically near to the catalytic Histidine residue, located at the highly conserved motif HXXXD. Nevertheless, the data related to the specific catalytic reaction mechanism of this protein superfamily has not been reported to date. In this work, using computational and molecular modeling tools, we attempted to propose a possible catalytic reaction mechanism and to explain the differences related to the aroma pattern in the strawberry specie *F*. *x ananassa* considering both molecular and energetic aspects.\n\nMaterials and Methods {#sec002}\n=====================\n\nMolecular modeling {#sec003}\n------------------\n\nThe protein sequence of SAAT was retrieved from NCBI protein sequence database (GeneBank accession number: AF193789). BLAST \\[[@pone.0153057.ref020]\\] (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) and PSIPRED (Protein Structure Prediction Server) \\[[@pone.0153057.ref021]\\] were used to select the available 3D protein structures with the closest homology in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) \\[[@pone.0153057.ref022]\\]. The chosen template was the crystal structure of protein vinorine synthase (PDB ID: 2BGH) from *Rauvolfia serpentina* that shares 33% of sequence identity with SAAT, including important conserved motifs from BAHD superfamily \\[[@pone.0153057.ref005]\\]. The crystal structure of the template is complete and has a resolution of 2.6 Å. Despite the low sequence identity between members of BAHD family, the selected crystal structure shows a high similarity with several CoA-dependent acyltransferases. Moreover, it has been established that a structural identity over 30% is an acceptable threshold that guarantees a successful homology modeling process \\[[@pone.0153057.ref023]\\]. A pair-wise sequence alignment, between SAAT and the template, was obtained by using CLUSTAL W software \\[[@pone.0153057.ref024]\\], in order to build the initial model. The homology model of SAAT structure was generated by using MODELLER 9v2 software ([[) \\[[@pone.0153057.ref025]\\]. Fifty models were generated; from which five models were selected according to the DOPE (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy) \\[[@pone.0153057.ref026]\\] score and their root mean squared deviation (RMSD) with respect to the trace of Cα atoms of the reference crystal structure. A loop optimization protocol was used to improve the quality of the five models. Finally, in order to select the best model among the 5 remaining, we evaluated the Phi and Psi angles using PROCHEK \\[[@pone.0153057.ref027]\\]. The model with the best stereochemistry was chosen for further analysis.\n\nIn order to refine the structural model and to get the best conformation of SAAT structure, its conformational space was studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) using Nanoescale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD v2.6) software and the Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Modeling (CHARMM27) force field for lipids and proteins \\[[@pone.0153057.ref028]\\], along with the TIP3P water model \\[[@pone.0153057.ref029]\\]. The tautomeric states of Histidine residues in the model were assigned according to their local environment through the PROPKA \\[[@pone.0153057.ref030]\\] utility. After an initial minimization, the system was subjected to a short MDS in order to remove wrong atomic contacts and to fill empty pockets, and finally to stabilize the energy of the model. To do so, 65000 steps were run using the conjugated-gradient method. All backbone atoms were restrained using a harmonic force constant of 0.5 kcal mol^-1^Å^-2^ and the loops were allowed to move during relaxation. All MDS were done using a timestep of 1 femtosecond (fs) with a 12Å spherical cutoff for non-bonding interactions and a switching function of 9Å for the van der Waals term. The structure obtained was embedded, using periodic boundary conditions (PBC), into a box of 78 x 86 x 92 Å^3^ contained in a 150 mM NaCl solution at 300 K and the isobaric-isothermal ensemble (NPT). Under these conditions, 2 ns of MDS were performed, using NAMD v2.6 software. Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) was employed to calculate long-range electrostatic interactions. Finally, the accuracy of the model was evaluated again through ANOLEA \\[[@pone.0153057.ref031]\\], \\[[@pone.0153057.ref032]\\] and PROCHECK \\[[@pone.0153057.ref027]\\].\n\nMolecular Docking {#sec004}\n-----------------\n\nDocking studies were performed with the goal to predict the putative binding modes of a set of acyl-CoAs and alcohols substrates. The resulting ester products, from those substrates selected for this study, have been previously described as constituents of *F*. *x ananassa* fruit's aroma. With this aim, two docking experiments were performed using ICM (Internal Coordinates Mechanics) software \\[[@pone.0153057.ref033]\\]. ICM is based on Monte Carlo simulations and it uses internal coordinates to optimize the orientation of molecules performing a stochastic global optimization method combined with pseudo-Brownian positional/torsional steps and fast local gradient minimization \\[[@pone.0153057.ref034]\\]. The ICM scoring function considered electrostatic, H-bonds, hydrophobic and two van der Waals terms, and the energies are computed using MMFF partial charges as described in the ECEPP/3 force field \\[[@pone.0153057.ref035]\\]. The grid points used, in order to define the docking conformational space for alcohols and acetyl-CoA within SAAT binding site, were 25×25×25 (grid center: -5.39, 4.78 and 3.34 Å) and 90×90×90 (grid center: -27.77, -19.58 and 13.95 Å), with a grid space of 0.5 Å, respectively. 10 docking replicas were performed for each molecule, generating 250 conformations for each replica. The best conformation was chosen based on the best docking scores.\n\nThe strategy for docking the substrates into the SAAT binding site was devised keeping in mind the formation of a ternary complex (acyl-CoA--alcohol--His157), which is needed for the catalytic reaction mechanism to take place. In that sense acetyl-CoA molecule, as acyl-CoA substrate, was docked first into the active site of SAAT; and then several alcohol substrate molecules (ethanol, butanol, hexanol, octanol and benzyl alcohol) were selected for docking, according to the chemical profile of esters experimentally reported for *F*. *x ananassa* fruit \\[[@pone.0153057.ref001]\\], and following the previous strategy reported by Morales-Quintana *et al*. \\[[@pone.0153057.ref017]\\]. The reverse docking procedure, first positioning the alcohols and then the acyl-CoA into the SAAT binding site, was also performed but the formation of ternary complexes and calculated docking energies were not favorable (data not shown).\n\nMolecular Dynamics Simulations of Ternary Complexes {#sec005}\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to analyze the dynamic behavior and stability of intermolecular interactions between the different substrates and SAAT, MD simulations of these systems were performed. In this case the ternary complexes (SAAT--acetyl-CoA--alcohol) were embedded in a water box of 72.74 x 90.97 x 78.74 Å^3^ at neutral conditions and using a concentration of 125 mM NaCl. The SPC water model was used within the framework of the OPLS-AA force field \\[[@pone.0153057.ref036]\\]. MDS were performed using Desmond software \\[[@pone.0153057.ref037]\\]. Before setup of routine MD simulations each ternary complex was minimized and pre-equilibrated using a relaxation routine implemented by default in Desmond. The program launches 9 steps composed of solute-solvent restrained minimizations and short MD relaxations (12 to 24 ps) that are used in order to stabilize the system. After that, an equilibration MD was done for 5 ns followed by 30 ns production MD simulation. The van der Waals and electrostatic interactions cutoff was set to 9 Å. The temperature was maintained at 300°K by Nose-Hoover chain thermostat method. The stability of the ternary complex was kept using 2 different restraints that were applied in two distances. The first one corresponded to the distance between the Nε of the residue His157 and the oxygen atom of the alcohol, while the second one corresponded to the distance between the same alcohol's oxygen atom and the carbonylic carbon of the Acetyl-CoA. For both distances a restraint, of 10 kcal mol^-1^ Å^-2^, was used.\n\nCalculation of binding free energy in the complexes {#sec006}\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe binding-free energy (Δ*G*~*bind*~), between each alcohol substrate and the SAAT--acetyl-CoA system, was calculated using the Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) method as implemented in Prime \\[[@pone.0153057.ref038],[@pone.0153057.ref039]\\]. These additional calculations were performed in order to better explain the affinity differences between the substrates and protein. The calculations were performed on each ternary complex system using 150 snapshots that were selected each 200 ps from the routine MD simulations. Averaged Δ*G*~*bind*~ values, between alcohols and SAAT protein, were calculated using the following equation: $$\\Delta G_{bind} = \\Delta E_{MM} + \\Delta G_{solv} + T\\Delta S$$ where Δ*E*~*MM*~ is the change in the gas phase MM energy upon binding, and includes Δ*E*~*internal*~ (bond, angle and dihedral energies), Δ*E*~*elect*~ (electrostatic) and Δ*E*~*vdw*~ (van der Waals) energies. Δ*G*~*solv*~ is the change in the solvation free energy upon binding, and includes the electrostatic solvation free energy Δ*G*~*solvGB*~ (polar contribution calculated using generalized Born model), and the nonelectrostatic solvation component Δ*G*~*solvSA*~ (nonpolar contribution estimated by solvent accessible surface area). Finally, *T*Δ*S* is the change of the conformational entropy upon binding; but this contribution term was not estimated in our calculations. Considering that alkyl alcohol substrates used in our study differ only in the length of their aliphatic chain (4 carbons atoms, at maximum), we decided to neglect the calculation of the entropy and its energetic contribution to Δ*G*~*bind*~ in all molecules. In principle, this entropic contribution is small taking values between 7--9 cal/mol\\*K for every methylene group added to the alkyl chain of the alcohol, according to experimental data reported for several alcohols (from ethanol to 1-heptanol) in condensed phase (please see NIST webpage: [[).\n\nResults and Discussion {#sec007}\n======================\n\nHomology Modeling {#sec008}\n-----------------\n\nAccording to searching process in BLAST, the best template for modeling the SAAT structure was the X-ray crystal structure of vironine synthase (from *Rauvolfia serpentina*) with a sequence identity of 33% and an E-value of 8 × 10^52^. The initial pair-wise alignment of the protein template (PDB ID code: 2BGH) against the target sequence (SAAT) with 32.4% of sequence identity and 50.6% of sequence similarity was optimized manually, incorporating information about secondary structure of the BAHD superfamily, specially in relation to the conserved motifs HXXXD and DFGWG, which were spatially restricted during modeling to avoid any distortion from their initial conformations (See [S1 Fig](#pone.0153057.s001){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).\n\nIn order to evaluate the geometric and energetic stability of the SAAT model, 5 conformers with the lowest total energy were selected after energy minimization. The best conformer was determined by using different evaluation methods. The stereo-chemical quality of SAAT model was analyzed with PROCHECK \\[[@pone.0153057.ref027]\\]. The most favored regions, according to Ramachandran plot, corresponded to 76% of the structure and only 2% of residues from the overall protein were placed in disallowed regions (none of them corresponded to conserved residues of the BAHD superfamily) (See [S2 Fig](#pone.0153057.s002){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). ANOLEA \\[[@pone.0153057.ref031],[@pone.0153057.ref032]\\] is a server that performs energy calculations on a protein chain, evaluating the \"Non-Local Environment\" (NLE) of each heavy atom in the molecule. In our model, all energy values derived from this calculation were favorable (values below 0 kcal/mol are shown in green in [S3 Fig](#pone.0153057.s003){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). That roughly means that ANOLEA program showed favorable scores for most of the structurally conserved regions in the 3D model of the SAAT protein. The final structure of SAAT protein was accepted for subsequent analysis.\n\nThe model obtained showed that SAAT protein is composed of 14 β-sheets and 12 α-helices forming a monomer with two domains connected by a large crossover loop (residues 195--218) ([Fig 1A](#pone.0153057.g001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Domain 1 contains 5 helices covered by 8--stranded β-sheets; and domain 2 contains a mixed 6-stranded β-sheets, which are covered on both sides by 7 helices. The catalytic residues His157 and Asp161, belonging to the HXXXD motif, are located at the middle of SAAT structure where their lateral chains were oriented to the catalytic cavity formed by both domains (See [S1 Scheme](#pone.0153057.s007){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). The other highly conserved motif DFGWG was located far from the catalytic site of SAAT ([Fig 1A](#pone.0153057.g001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). It is noticeable that SAAT front face has a positively charged surface, which seems adequate for the interaction with the tri-phosphate residues of the CoA group ([Fig 1B](#pone.0153057.g001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). On the contrary, the SAAT back face showed a less positive charged environment ([Fig 1C](#pone.0153057.g001){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![A) SAAT homology model.

First, in order to explore the binding modes of the alcohols and the acetyl-CoA within SAAT active site, molecular docking simulation was performed. Acetyl-CoA was the only acyl derivative tested on the present work in order to reproduce Aharoni's previous experimental results \\[[@pone.0153057.ref001]\\]. On the other hand, we used octanol/hexanol and benzyl alcohol/ethanol/butanol since theses alcohols showed the highest and lowest affinity, respectively, with respect to SAAT (according to Aharoni's previous work). Additionally, Ma *et al*. \\[[@pone.0153057.ref014]\\] identified that vinorine synthase has a solvent channel that runs through the entire molecule, allowing the substrate and co-substrate to bind independently. These authors proposed that acetyl-CoA binds to the front face of the enzyme. According to our molecular docking results, the acetyl-CoA is positioned into the solvent channel entering through the front face and adopting an extended conformation, where the acetyl group is located near the SAAT active site ([Fig 2](#pone.0153057.g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Furthermore, the phosphate groups of the CoA established electrostatic interactions with the positively charged residues Arg177 and Arg180 of SAAT ([Fig 2](#pone.0153057.g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}). In order to explore the dynamic conformational behavior that acetyl-CoA could undergo inside SAAT front face pocket, a 5ns long MD simulation was performed. From MD simulation results, it was observed that phosphate groups of CoA remain close to the above mentioned positively charged residues and the acetyl group also remains close to the catalytic residue His157 without establishing any additional hydrogen bond interactions with other residues within active site. The averaged distances for those intermolecular interactions, and their standard deviation, are reported in [S1 Table](#pone.0153057.s008){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}.\n\n![Main established interactions by Acetyl-CoA at the front face pocket in SAAT\\\n.

Overall, the computed binding free energies obtained from molecular docking showed that as the number of carbon atoms in the alcohol structure increased, their affinity by SAAT model also increased ([Table 1](#pone.0153057.t001){ref-type=\"table\"}), where SAAT has more affinity (in terms of binding free energy from docking) for hexanol and octanol substrates. The benzyl alcohol low affinity was also reproduced and it could be explained by the narrow shape of the pocket, which could prefer the inclusion of alcohols with linear chains instead of aromatic scaffolds (see [S1 Scheme](#pone.0153057.s007){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}**)**. The main molecular entities participating in the catalytic reaction of SAAT: the enzyme, acetyl-CoA and alcohols are represented in [Fig 3](#pone.0153057.g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}, as it was described previously by Suzuki *et al*. \\[[@pone.0153057.ref009]\\] According to our model and molecular docking results, the acetyl-CoA is located inside the pocket at the front face of SAAT, where the phosphate residues of the CoA group interact with positively charged arginine residues in this area and the acetyl group is oriented towards the catalytic site. There is a space between the catalytic residue His157 and the carbonylic carbon of the acetyl-CoA allowing the interaction of the alcohols with that acid-base residue through hydrogen bond interactions ([Fig 3](#pone.0153057.g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}). These molecular modeling results agreed with previous proposed mechanism for the reaction catalyzed by AATs where the authors found that a ternary complex is formed between enzyme, alcohol and acyl-CoA \\[[@pone.0153057.ref012]\\]. Then, a general base (His157 residue in SAAT) would deprotonate the hydroxyl group of the alcohol to facilitate its nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of acyl-CoA, and the subsequent formation of ester product \\[[@pone.0153057.ref009], [@pone.0153057.ref040]\\].\n\nOn the other hand, and regarding the relative ester production from ATTs, SAAT have a solvent channel with a volume and area of 670.993 Å^3^ and 642.739 Å^2^, respectively. These volume and area of the channel were obtained by ICM through PocketFinder module \\[[@pone.0153057.ref033]\\]. It pass through the enzyme allowing both substrates to interact with residue His157 simultaneously, generating mainly ester derivatives \\[[@pone.0153057.ref001]\\]. The size and shape of the solvent channel seem to have a relevant role in the substrate selectivity and furthermore in the ATT enzyme ability to produce a certain ester kind. Our modeling results in SAAT are in agreement with different studies performed in another members of the BAHD superfamily \\[[@pone.0153057.ref018],[@pone.0153057.ref019]\\] (See [S1 Scheme](#pone.0153057.s007){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).\n\nMolecular Dynamic simulations of SAAT--acetyl-CoA--alcohol complexes {#sec010}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe goal of subsequent MD simulations, on the ternary complexes obtained through molecular docking, was two-fold: to refine and keep the reactive structure of the ternary complexes and to include their flexibility for an accurately estimation of the affinity of alcohols by SAAT using the MM-GBSA approach. Results from MD simulations suggested that ternary complexes were stable throughout all the equilibration simulation time (See [S4](#pone.0153057.s004){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"} and [S5](#pone.0153057.s005){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"} Figs). The key distances established between the substrates and enzyme in ternary complexes were measured, along with their fluctuation through MD simulations, and are shown in [Fig 4](#pone.0153057.g004){ref-type=\"fig\"}. As can be seen, the distances between alcohol's oxygen atom and the carbonylic carbon of the acetyl-CoA (dHO•••O = C-AcCoA) as well as the distances between the oxygen atoms of the alcohols and the N~ε~ atom of residue His157 (dHO•••N~ε-~His157) remained stable along the entire production MD simulations. This roughly means that ternary complexes are stable in their present molecular conformations. It is important to note that these stable ternary complexes represent reactive conformations and may allow the esterification reaction to occur successfully in all molecular systems studied.\n\n![Main distances established between ligands and catalytic residues at the SAAT active site during 30 ns of MD simulations.\\\n(A) Distances between the oxygen atom of the alcohols and the carbonylic carbon of the acetyl-CoA (dHO•••O = C-AcCoA); (B) Distances between the oxygen atom of the alcohols and the Nε of the His157 (dHO•••N~ε-~His157).

The Δ*G*~*bind*~ values showed that SAAT--acetyl-CoA complex presented more affinity by octanol (Δ*G*~*bind*~ = -44.2 kcal/mol), followed by hexanol (Δ*G*~*bind*~ = -41.0 kcal/mol), and finally there is a lower affinity by butanol and benzyl alcohol (Δ*G*~*bind*~ ≈ -25.0 kcal/mol).

These terms are more favorable for octanol and hexanol (in more than 3 and 16 kcal/mol, respectively) with respect to the remaining alcohol substrates. Moreover, the difference in affinity between octanol and hexanol is mainly dictated by Δ*G*~*solvGB*~ and Δ*G*~*vdw*~ terms.\n\nConclusions {#sec012}\n===========\n\nIn the present research work a model structure of SAAT protein, forming complexes with acetyl-CoA and different alcohol substrates, was studied. The *in silico* model obtained for SAAT allowed us to dissect the most important structural characteristics of this AAT member of the BAHD family. From homology modeling, it was found that SAAT is a globular protein with 2 domains bonded by a connector loop, with the conserved motif HXXXD in the middle of the protein looking directly into the solvent channel. The complex structure of SAAT with acetyl-CoA, obtained from molecular docking calculations, suggested that acetyl-CoA molecule was located in the same position as the one found in the crystallographic structure of *vironine synthase* that was used as template. The above mentioned results in some way validated our model and gave us confidence about the SAAT--acetyl-CoA complex obtained in the first part of our computational study. The molecular dynamic simulations results, for the dynamical behavior of acetyl-CoA within SAAT protein, suggest several important points about the possible reaction mechanism used by SAAT. First, it seems that the position adopted by acetyl-CoA into SAAT has an important role in allowing the alcohol substrates to enter the active site and interact effectively with the catalytic residue His157. Molecular docking results showed that inside the wide cavity at the center of solvent channel, alcohols could adopt several different binding conformations according to their length. Second, a carefully analysis into the best molecular docking conformers obtained for alcohol substrates, allowed us to confirm the putative catalytic role of His157. This was the only reported catalytic residue that could interact with the majority of the alcohol substrates, stabilize them inside the solvent channel in an appropriate reactive conformation with respect to carbonylic carbon in acetyl-CoA. The favorable binding energy values obtained from the docking simulations also suggested that interactions between the alcohol substrates and SAAT are thermodynamic and structurally feasible. The formation and stabilization of this ternary complex during the MD simulations also supported our initial hypothesis for the biological mechanism used by SAAT in order to produce esters volatiles. Finally the MM-GBSA analysis, on several frames taken along the 30 ns MD simulations from all complexes, confirmed our initial protein-substrate affinity results from the docking experiments. Additionally, this binding free energy analysis allowed us to correctly rank the affinity of alcohol substrates by SAAT and also to estimate the importance of the Δ*G*~*bind*~ components in differential complex formation. It was found that vdW interactions, as well as the lipophilic nature of the alcohols, are the most important terms for the correct binding of this substrates near to His157. In summary, our computational analysis suggested that characteristic aroma pattern in SAAT would be related with the availability of the alcohol substrates with a specific alkyl chain length. Also, it can be suggested, in the light of the presented results, that ternary complex mechanism could be the most reasonable mechanism for biological reaction catalyzed by this member of acyltransferases. However a detailed atomistic study about the proton and acetyl transfer reaction mechanisms catalyzed by SAAT is needed in order to validate such initial hypothesis.\n\nIn future research work, the effect of the length of the acyl-CoA substrate as well as the alcohol's into the formation of the ternary complex on SAAT, and subsequently on the formation of the esters, will be studied. At present, ongoing computational work is being performed in our group with the aim to study, using gathered information from this work and quantum mechanics approaches, the enzymatic reaction mechanism catalyzed by SAAT for ester volatiles production.\n\nSupporting Information {#sec013}\n======================\n\n###### Sequence alignment between Vironina synthase (*Rauvolfia serpentina*) and the AAT of *Fragaria ananassa*.\n\nThe highly conserved motifs HXXXD and DFGWG are highlighted in yellow.\n\n(TIFF)\n\n###### \n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n###### Ramachandran plot of SAAT model.\n\n(TIFF)\n\n###### \n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n###### Evaluation of non-local environment interactions performed by the atomic empirical mean force potential ANOLEA on each heavy atom in the SAAT model.\n\nNegatives energies (on green) represent favorable interactions of the respective residue.\n\n(TIFF)\n\n###### \n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n###### RMSD values of SAAT--acetylCoA--octanol (upper left), SAAT--acetylCoA--hexanol (upper right), SAAT--acetylCoA--benzylalcohol (bottom left) and SAAT--acetylCoA--butanol complexes (bottom right), measured during the 5ns equilibration molecular dynamics simulation.\n\nOn black is represented the protein backbone, on red the acetylCoA substrate and on green the respective alcohol.\n\n(TIFF)\n\n###### \n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n###### Main distances established between ligands and catalytic residues at the SAAT active site during 5 ns of MD simulations.\n\n\\(A\\) Distances between the oxygen atom of the alcohols and the carbonylic carbon of the acetyl-CoA (dHO•••O = C-AcCoA); (B) Distances between the oxygen atom of the alcohols and the Nε of the His157 (dHO•••N~ε-~His157).

The National Allergen Survey, a study of allergen types and levels in floor and bedding dust in the nation's housing, is the first study to provide estimates of allergen exposure in the U.S. population. It encompasses 831 homes in 75 primary sampling units located throughout the country. The major endpoints are measurements of dust mite, cockroach, cat, dog, mouse, rat and fungal allergen levels, and endotoxin in dust samples collected from an array of sites in the surveyed homes. Results from analysis of dust mite allergens suggest that approximately 24% of U.S. homes have beds that contain >10 microgram dust mite allergen/gram dust (a level previously associated with symptomatic asthma) and approximately 46% of U.S. homes have beds that contain >2 microgram dust mite allergen/gram dust (a level previously associated with mite allergen sensitization). The likelihood of having a high dust mite allergen level in the bed was greater for older homes, non-western region homes, lower income households and bedrooms with higher humidity. Dog and cat allergens were universally present in U.S. homes. Levels were higher among homes with an indoor dog and/or cat; however, among homes without an indoor pet, mean allergen concentrations were still well above proposed thresholds for allergic sensitization and disease. Mouse allergen was detectable in approximately 82% of U.S. homes and levels exceeded proposed sentization thresholds in 22% of homes. The likelihood of having high mouse allergen levels in the kitchen was greater in high rise apartments, mobile homes, older homes, low income homes, homes where rodent or cockroach problems were reported, and when floor mopping was performed instead of vacuuming. This nationally representative survey has (a) provided current estimates of indoor allergen exposure in the U.S. population, (b) established a database that can be used to stimulate future studies which attempt to correlate allergen exposure to disease outcome, (c) provided a baseline that can be used as a reference point for future allergen surveys, and (d) facilitated evaluation of regional, ethnic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristic differences in the allergen burden. We have also conducted a randomized clinical trial to test the feasibility/effectiveness of environmental interventions in reducing cockroach allergen levels in inner-city North Carolina homes. Our study demonstrated that the combination of cockroach extermination and intensive cleaning can significantly reduce cockroach allergen levels in highly infested homes. Moreover, the effect can be maintained for up to 12 months with continued extermination. Surprisingly, cockroach extermination alone can also significantly reduce cockroach allergen levels in low income homes over a 6 month period. The results of these studies will be used to design a prevention trial to determine if environmental intervention aimed at reducing indoor allergen levels can prevent sensitization and decrease the prevalence and morbidity of asthma in high risk children living in poverty.", "category": "medicine_health_psychology_traditional_chinese_medicine"}

{"text": "A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the\nevacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma\nare erupted over a short time, structural support for the crust above\nthe magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward\ninto the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression\nat the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter).\nAlthough sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a\ntype of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse\nrather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming\ncollapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most\nrecently at\nBárðarbungaBárðarbunga volcano in Iceland.[1]\n\nEtymology[edit]\nThe word comes from Spanish caldera, and\nLatinLatin caldaria, meaning\n\"cooking pot\". In some texts the English term cauldron is also used.\nThe term caldera was introduced into the geological vocabulary by the\nGerman geologist\nLeopold von BuchLeopold von Buch when he published his memoirs of his\n1815 visit to the Canary Islands,[note 1] where he first saw the Las\nCañadas caldera on Tenerife, with Montaña\nTeideTeide dominating the\nlandscape, and then the\nCaldera de TaburienteCaldera de Taburiente on La Palma.\nCalderaCaldera formation[edit]\n\nLandsatLandsat image of Lake Toba, on the island of Sumatra,\nIndonesiaIndonesia (100\nkm/62 mi long and 30 km/19 mi wide, one of the world's largest\ncalderas). A resurgent dome formed the island of Samosir.\n\nA collapse is triggered by the emptying of the magma chamber beneath\nthe volcano, sometimes as the result of a large explosive volcanic\neruption (see Tambora in 1815), but also during effusive eruptions on\nthe flanks of a volcano (see\nPiton de la FournaisePiton de la Fournaise in 2007) or in a\nconnected fissure system (see\nBárðarbungaBárðarbunga in 2014-2015). If enough\nmagma is ejected, the emptied chamber is unable to support the weight\nof the volcanic edifice above it. A roughly circular fracture, the\n\"ring fault\", develops around the edge of the chamber. Ring fractures\nserve as feeders for fault intrusions which are also known as ring\ndykes. Secondary volcanic vents may form above the ring fracture. As\nthe magma chamber empties, the center of the volcano within the ring\nfracture begins to collapse. The collapse may occur as the result of a\nsingle cataclysmic eruption, or it may occur in stages as the result\nof a series of eruptions. The total area that collapses may be\nhundreds or thousands of square kilometers.\nMineralization[edit]\nSome calderas are known to host rich ore deposits. One of the world's\nbest-preserved mineralized calderas is the\nSturgeon Lake Caldera in\nnorthwestern Ontario, Canada, which formed during the Neoarchean\nera[2] about 2,700 million years ago.[3]\nExplosive caldera eruptions[edit]\nFurther information: Explosive eruption\nIf the magma is rich in silica, the caldera is often filled in with\nignimbrite, tuff, rhyolite, and other igneous rocks. Silica-rich magma\nhas a high viscosity, and therefore does not flow easily like basalt.\nAs a result, gases tend to become trapped at high pressure within the\nmagma. When the magma approaches the surface of the Earth, the rapid\noff-loading of overlying material causes the trapped gases to\ndecompress rapidly, thus triggering explosive destruction of the magma\nand spreading volcanic ash over wide areas. Further lava flows may be\nerupted.\nIf volcanic activity continues, the center of the caldera may be\nuplifted in the form of a resurgent dome such as is seen at Cerro\nGalán, Lake Toba, Yellowstone, etc., by subsequent intrusion of\nmagma. A silicic or rhyolitic caldera may erupt hundreds or even\nthousands of cubic kilometers of material in a single event. Even\nsmall caldera-forming eruptions, such as\nKrakatoaKrakatoa in 1883 or Mount\nPinatubo in 1991, may result in significant local destruction and a\nnoticeable drop in temperature around the world. Large calderas may\nhave even greater effects.\nWhen\nYellowstone CalderaYellowstone Caldera last erupted some 650,000 years ago, it\nreleased about 1,000 km3 of material (as measured in dense rock\nequivalent (DRE)), covering a substantial part of\nNorth AmericaNorth America in up\nto two metres of debris. By comparison, when\nMount St. HelensMount St. Helens erupted\nin 1980, it released ~1.2 km3 (DRE) of ejecta. The ecological\neffects of the eruption of a large caldera can be seen in the record\nof the\nLake TobaLake Toba eruption in Indonesia.\nToba[edit]\nMain article: Lake Toba\nAbout 74,000 years ago, this Indonesian volcano released about\n2,800 km3 DRE of ejecta, the largest known eruption within the\nQuaternaryQuaternary Period (last 1.8 million years) and the largest known\nexplosive eruption within the last 25 million years. In the late\n1990s, anthropologist Stanley Ambrose[4] proposed that a volcanic\nwinter induced by this eruption reduced the human population to about\n2,000-20,000 individuals, resulting in a population bottleneck (see\nToba catastrophe theory). More recently several geneticists, including\nLynn Jorde and\nHenry Harpending have proposed that the human species\nwas reduced to approximately five to ten thousand people.[5] However,\nthere is no direct evidence that the theory is correct, and there is\nno evidence for any other animal decline or extinction, even in\nenvironmentally sensitive species.[6] There is evidence that human\nhabitation continued in\nIndiaIndia after the eruption.[7] The theory in its\nstrongest form may be incorrect.\nEruptions forming even larger calderas are known, especially La Garita\nCalderaCaldera in the\nSan Juan MountainsSan Juan Mountains of Colorado, where the 5,000-km3\nFish Canyon\nTuffTuff was blasted out in a single major eruption about\n27.8 million years ago.\nAt some points in geological time, rhyolitic calderas have appeared in\ndistinct clusters. The remnants of such clusters may be found in\nplaces such as the\nSan Juan MountainsSan Juan Mountains of\nColoradoColorado (formed during the\nOligocene, Miocene, and\nPliocenePliocene periods) or the Saint Francois\nMountain Range of\nMissouriMissouri (erupted during the Proterozoic).\n\nSollipulliSollipulli Caldera, located in central\nChileChile near the border with\nArgentina, filled with ice. The volcano sits in the southern Andes\nMountains within Chile's Parque Nacional Villarica.[8]\n\nSome volcanoes, such as shield volcanoes\nKīlaueaKīlauea and Mauna Loa\n(respectively the most active and second largest on Earth, are both on\nthe island of Hawaii), form calderas in a different fashion. The magma\nfeeding these volcanoes is basalt which is silica poor. As a result,\nthe magma is much less viscous than the magma of a rhyolitic volcano,\nand the magma chamber is drained by large lava flows rather than by\nexplosive events. The resulting calderas are also known as subsidence\ncalderas, and can form more gradually than explosive calderas. For\ninstance, the caldera atop\nFernandina IslandFernandina Island underwent a collapse in\n1968, when parts of the caldera floor dropped 350 meters.[9] Kilauea\nCalderaCaldera has an inner crater known as Halema'uma'u, which has often\nbeen filled by a lava lake.\nDuring the April 2007 eruption of the\nPiton de la FournaisePiton de la Fournaise on the\nisland of Réunion, the floor of the main crater suddenly dropped\nabout 300 m. This was attributed to the withdrawal of magma which was\nbeing erupted through a vent lower down on the southern flank of the\nvolcano.\nAnother process that may allow a caldera to form can occur if molten\nlava can escape through a breach on the caldera's rim.\nExtraterrestrial calderas[edit]\nSince the early 1960s, it has been known that volcanism has occurred\non other planets and moons in the Solar System. Through the use of\nmanned and unmanned spacecraft, volcanism has been discovered on\nVenus, Mars, the Moon, and Io, a satellite of Jupiter. None of these\nworlds have plate tectonics, which contributes approximately 60% of\nthe Earth's volcanic activity (the other 40% is attributed to hotspot\nvolcanism).[10]\nCalderaCaldera structure is similar on all of these planetary\nbodies, though the size varies considerably. The average caldera\ndiameter on\nVenusVenus is 68 km. The average caldera diameter on Io is\nclose to 40 km, and the mode is 6 km;\nTvashtar PateraeTvashtar Paterae is\nlikely the largest caldera with a diameter of 290 km. The average\ncaldera diameter on\nMarsMars is 48 km, smaller than Venus. Calderas\non Earth are the smallest of all planetary bodies and vary from 1.6 to\n80 km as a maximum.[11]\nThe Moon[edit]\nThe\nMoonMoon has an outer shell of low-density crystalline rock that is a\nfew hundred kilometers thick, which formed due to a rapid creation.\nThe craters of the moon have been well preserved through time and were\nonce thought to have been the result of extreme volcanic activity, but\nactually were formed by meteorites, nearly all of which took place in\nthe first few hundred million years after the\nMoonMoon formed. Around\n500 million years afterward, the Moon's mantle was able to be\nextensively melted due to the decay of radioactive elements. Massive\nbasaltic eruptions took place generally at the base of large impact\ncraters. Also, eruptions may have taken place due to a magma reservoir\nat the base of the crust. This forms a dome, possibly the same\nmorphology of a shield volcano where calderas universally are known to\nform.[10] Although caldera-like structures are rare on the Moon, they\nare not completely absent. The Compton-Belkovich Volcanic Complex on\nthe far side of the\nMoonMoon is thought to be a caldera, possibly an\nash-flow caldera.[12]\nMars[edit]\nFurther information: Volcanology of Mars\nThe volcanic activity of\nMarsMars is concentrated in two major provinces:\nTharsisTharsis and Elysium. Each province contains a series of giant shield\nvolcanoes that are similar to what we see on Earth and likely are the\nresult of mantle hot spots. The surfaces are dominated by lava flows,\nand all have one or more collapse calderas.[10]\nMarsMars has the largest\nvolcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, which is more than three\ntimes the height of Mount Everest, with a diameter of 520 km (323\nmiles). The summit of the mountain has six nested calderas.[13]\nVenus[edit]\nFurther information: Volcanology of Venus\nBecause there is no plate tectonics on Venus, heat is mainly lost by\nconduction through the lithosphere. This causes enormous lava flows,\naccounting for 80% of Venus' surface area. Many of the mountains are\nlarge shield volcanoes that range in size from 150-400 km in\ndiameter and 2-4 km high. More than 80 of these large shield\nvolcanoes have summit calderas averaging 60 km across.[10]\nIo[edit]\nFurther information: Volcanology of Io\nIo, unusually, is heated by solid flexing due to the tidal influence\nof\nJupiterJupiter and Io's orbital resonance with neighboring large moons\nEuropa and Ganymede, which keeps its orbit slightly eccentric. Unlike\nany of the planets mentioned, Io is continuously volcanically active.\nFor example, the NASA\nVoyager 1Voyager 1 and\nVoyager 2Voyager 2 spacecraft detected nine\nerupting volcanoes while passing Io in 1979. Io has many calderas with\ndiameters tens of kilometers across.[10]\nList of volcanic calderas[edit]\nSee also:", "category": "mining"}

This involves either bringing in expensive security firms that are unable to patrol the whole building 24 hors a day or boarding up the building/adding metal shuttering, which looks ugly, annoys the neighbours and can substantially devalue a neighbourhood.\n\nSecurity firms can cost up to £12 per hour (£2000 per week) and costs will rise with the addition of dogs and/or security systems. Metal shuttering can be off-putting to a potential buyer and inspections can prove difficult. It's also expensive to install them: on average, they cost approximately £100 per week (for about 6 windows/doors). All of these costs soon mount up, especially as a shuttered property is likely to remain on the market for longer.\n\nWooden boarding is less effective than shuttering, as boards can be removed easily by anyone wanting to gain access. If boarding is forcibly removed, damage may be caused and there will then be an additional cost to replace it or to take out a different form of security. To avoid the need for either security firms or boarding up, some developers consider the option of a live in property guardian.\n\nWe spoke to Guardians of London who specialise in providing this service:-\n\nWhat are the benefits of a property guardian?\n\n\"There are plenty of benefits to a guardian in an empty property, the key one being cost. Developers can avoid the need for either security firms or boarding up and will only pay a fraction of the cost.The presence of guardians in the building 24 hours a day will bring peace of mind to both the developer and the neighbourhood. They also help to protect the building against dilapidation, as any potential problems such as leaks can be spotted early and dealt with immediately.\n\nThe property is kept aired and heated, preventing further deterioration and insurance premiums on the property can be reduced, as the property is no longer vacant. An even bigger benefit to the developer is that their presence helps to mitigate against the developer having to pay 100% business rates (normally payable after the first 3 months of the property being vacated). Add to that the revenue that developers can make from a percentage of the weekly licence fee (rather than monthly rent) that the guardians pay and it makes total sense for a developer to go down the property guardian route to secure their empty building.\"\n\nHow do you select your guardians?\n\n\"All of our property guardians are carefully vetted beforehand and are normally young professionals, sometimes key workers. They must be in full-time employment and have to adhere to a strict code of rules such as not having any parties and not using candles or any naked flames, which can be a fire risk.\"\n\nWhat type of properties are suitable?\n\n\"A wide variety of buildings can be adapted for property guardians, including former schools, Royal Mail sorting offices, warehouses, pubs, ex-care homes or office blocks. We will always inspect a property first before putting guardians into it, in order to conduct a fire risk assessment and evaluate whether the building is habitable, air and watertight and whether it has kitchen and shower/toilet facilities on site. If not, we will install both at a low cost to the developer. Once guardians are installed in a building, we will then carry out bi-weekly inspections, to check for leaks, rubbish, fly-tipping and mould etc\"\n\nHow can London developers get in touch?\n\n\"Any property developers with empty properties that need securing can get in touch with Guardian of London via the following methods:-\"", "category": "real_estate_construction"}
{"text": "---\nabstract: '[Physical equivalence between different conformal frames in scalar-tensor theory of gravity is a known fact. However, assuming that matter minimally couples to the metric of a particular frame, which we call the matter Jordan frame, the matter point of view of the universe may vary from frame to frame. Thus, there is a clear distinction between gravitational sector (curvature and scalar field) and matter sector. In this paper, focusing on a simple power-law inflation model in the Einstein frame, two examples are considered; a super-inflationary and a bouncing universe Jordan frames. Then we consider a spectator curvaton minimally coupled to a Jordan frame, and compute its contribution to the curvature perturbation power spectrum. In these specific examples, we find a blue tilt at short scales for the super-inflationary case, and a blue tilt at large scales for the bouncing case.]{}'\nauthor:\n- Guillem Domènech\n- Misao Sasaki\nbibliography:\n- 'bibliography.bib'\ntitle: Conformal Frame Dependence of Inflation\n---\n\nIntroduction \\[intro\\]\n======================\n\nScalar fields non-minimally coupled to gravity naturally arise in higher dimensional theories, such us string theory (for examples see [@fujii2003scalar]), and are attractive from a renormalization point of view [@lavrov2010renormalization]. Such effective field theory can be described within the framework of Scalar-tensor theory of gravity, first introduced by Jordan [@jordan1959gegenwartigen] and followed by Brans and Dicke [@brans1961mach], who realised that by means of a field dependent conformal transformation, i.e. a field dependent re-scaling of the metric, the non-minimal coupling can be absorbed and we are left with the usual Einstein-Hilbert action with a scalar field. Thus, this led to the notion of two distinct frames; the Einstein frame where the scalar is minimally coupled, and a Jordan frame where a non-minimal coupling is present. Here and throughout the paper, we define the Jordan frame as the one in which matter fields are minimally coupled with the metric of the frame. Conversely, matter fields have a universal dilatonic coupling with the scalar field in the Einstein frame.\n\nThere have been many controversial arguments about the physical equivalence of conformal frames and much effort has been made to clarify the situation [@makino1991density; @faraoni2007pseudo; @deruelle2011conformal; @gong2011conformal; @white2012curvature; @jarv2014invariant; @catena2007einstein; @chiba2013conformal; @chiba2008extended; @qiu2012reconstruction; @li2014generating]. The general conclusion at the classical level is that although physically equivalent, interpretations differ from frame to frame. On the contrary, it is still unclear whether they are equivalent at the quantum level [@george2014quantum] or not [@kamenshchik2014frame]. To our opinion it seems it needs quantum gravity to settle down this problem at the quantum level.\n\nInflation is widely accepted as the model of the early universe and is supported by current data [@hinshaw2013nine; @ade2013planck; @ade2013planck2]. As scalar fields play an important role in driving inflation, it is of interest to consider the consequences and implications of the case when the inflaton field is non-minimally coupled to gravity. More specifically, we are interested in the case where there is a Jordan frame in which the inflaton field is non-minimally coupled while matter fields are minimally coupled.\n\nHowever, since there are functional degrees of freedom in the form of the non-minimal coupling, it does not give us any useful insight if we stick to the general case. On the other hand, if we restrict our consideration too strongly, then we would not be able to learn much from it. Here, we focus on a simple but exact model which can be treated analytically, yet allows sufficient varieties in its outcome. Namely, we choose the power-law inflation model [@lucchin1985power] which is realised by an exponential potential. We assume this is what we have in the Einstein frame. In this case, the general solution is known analytically [@russo2004exact; @andrianov2011general].\n\nThe purpose of this work is to study how the physics from the matter point of view may vary from frame to frame in the explicit case of power-law inflation. For this purpose a simple way is to start in the Einstein frame and, by means of a conformal transformation, we go to a Jordan frame where matter is defined to be minimally coupled to the metric.\n\nThe structure of this work is as follows. In section \\[] we briefly review the general conformal transformation in a scalar-tensor theory, and apply it to power-law inflation. In section \\[] we introduce a curvaton to our model, and study its behaviour in a Jordan frame. It turns out that this simple curvaton model can give rise to an interesting physics from the matter point of view, and therefore may generate interesting features in the CMB angular spectrum. Finally in section \\[] we summarise the result and discuss its possible imprints in observational data.\n\nPower-law inflation {#sec:pl}\n===================\n\nThe action for a tensor-scalar theory in the Einstein frame reads $$\\begin{aligned}\n&&S_g=\n\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g}\\left(\\frac{M_{pl}^2}{2}R\n-\\frac{1}{2}g^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\partial_\\nu\\varphi\n-V[\\varphi]\\right),\\label{eh}\\end{aligned}$$ where $M_{pl}$ is the Planck mass, $\\varphi$ is an inflaton field and the sub-index $S_g$ stands for the gravitational sector. After an arbitrary conformal transformation, $$\\begin{aligned}\ng_{\\mu\\nu}= F[\\varphi]\\tilde{g}_{\\mu\\nu}, \\label{conftrans}\\end{aligned}$$ where $F[\\varphi]$ is a well-behaved non-zero function, we obtain the corresponding action in a Jordan frame, $$\\begin{aligned}\n&&S_g=\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-\\tilde{g}} \n\\left(\\frac{M_{pl}^2}{2}F[\\tilde{\\varphi}]\\tilde{R}\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{g}^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_\\mu\\tilde{\\varphi}\n\\partial_\\nu\\tilde{\\varphi}-\\tilde{V}[\\tilde{\\varphi}]\\right),\n\\label{jaction}\\end{aligned}$$ where the scalar field has been redefined by $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\frac{d\\tilde{\\varphi}}{d\\varphi}\\right)^2=F[\\varphi]\n\\left|1-\\frac{3}{2}M_{pl}^2\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln F}\n{\\partial\\varphi}\\right)^2\\right|\n\\label{field}\\end{aligned}$$ and the new potential is $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{V}[\\tilde{\\varphi}]\n=V[\\varphi(\\tilde{\\varphi})]F^{2}[\\varphi(\\tilde{\\varphi})].\\end{aligned}$$ According to [@gong2011conformal; @white2012curvature] both actions lead to the same curvature power spectrum and, hence, they are indistinguishable observationally, for example in the Cosmic Microwave Background. Besides, regarding the running of the units [@dicke1962mach; @faraoni2007pseudo] we assume that after inflation the inflaton settles down to its minimum. As a result, the Einstein and Jordan frames become equivalent.\n\nThus, one may wonder why should we consider Jordan frames if the Einstein frame is much simpler. In fact, once we take matter into account, one can usually define a frame where matter is minimally coupled to the metric and therefore, as matter is concerned, physical interpretations in that frame are straightforward. In this sense, the gravitational sector, namely the terms composed of the scalar curvature and the inflaton, is generally physically independent of the *arbitrary* re-scaling function $F[\\varphi]$, while the matter sector is not.\n\nTo illustrate this, we consider the Jordan frame where a matter field $\\chi$ is minimally coupled to the metric, $$\\begin{aligned}\nS_m=\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-\\tilde{g}}{\\cal{L}}_m[\\tilde{g}^{\\mu\\nu},\\chi].\n\\label{mpv}\\end{aligned}$$ Transforming back to the Einstein frame , we are left with a non-minimal coupling of the matter with the inflaton through $F[\\varphi]$, $$\\begin{aligned}\nS_m=\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g}F^{-2}{\\cal{L}}_m[F[\\varphi]g^{\\mu\\nu},\\chi].\\end{aligned}$$\n\nPower-law inflation was first introduced by Lucchin and Matarrese  [@lucchin1985power] where it was shown that a scalar field with an exponential potential, $$\\begin{aligned}\nV[\\varphi]=V_0e^{-\\lambda\\varphi/M_{pl}},\\end{aligned}$$ in a flat FLRW background, $$\\begin{aligned}\nds^2=-dt^2+a^2d\\textbf{x}^2,\\end{aligned}$$ give rise to an exact power-law solution, $$\\begin{aligned}\na=a_0(t/t_0)^p\\quad (0<t<\\infty)\\,,\\end{aligned}$$ where $p=2/\\lambda^2$ and $\\lambda^2V_0t^2_0=2M^2_{pl}(3p-1)$. As a result, this solution describes an initial big bang followed by an eternal expansion. The Hubble and slow-roll parameters are given respectively by $$\\begin{aligned}\nH\\equiv\\dot{a}/a=p/t\\,,\\label{hubble}\n\\\\\n\\epsilon\\equiv -\\dot H/H^2=1/p\\,,\\end{aligned}$$ where a dot refers to the derivative with respect to the proper time $t$. The solution to the scalar field equation, $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\ddot{\\varphi}+3H\\dot{\\varphi}+V,_{\\varphi}=0,\\end{aligned}$$ is given by $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\varphi=\\frac{2M_{pl}}{\\lambda}\\ln(t/t_0)\\,,\n\\label{phi}\\end{aligned}$$ Furthermore, comparing and we are led to the equality, $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\lambda H M_{pl}=\\dot{\\varphi}\\label{lhphi},\\end{aligned}$$ which will be used later.\n\nFollowing the work of [@russo2004exact; @andrianov2011general], one can check that $p>1$ corresponds to an inflationary attractor solution, as it can be seen from Fig. \\[diagram\\]. Likewise, one can check that there are essentially two types of general solutions corresponding to two distinct initial conditions, i.e. the field starts rolling up or the field starts rolling down the potential. We decided not to consider these solutions further in this work due to not-well-defined initial conditions when computing the curvature perturbation power spectrum. For a detailed review of the solutions, see [@russo2004exact; @andrianov2011general].\n\n![Phase space diagram for a particular $\\lambda$. Black line stands for the attractor power-law solution, whereas the colored lines are the two families of general solutions (rolling-up solutions below the black line and rolling-down solutions above the black line).[]{data-label=\"diagram\"}](figure1.png){width=\"0.6\\columnwidth\"}\n\nPrimordial fluctuations\n-----------------------\n\nThe next stage is to compute the primordial power spectrum for this attractor solution, with the help of cosmological perturbation theory [@kodama1984cosmological; @mukhanov1992theory]. First, we consider the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation for the curvature perturbation [@; @sasaki1986large], $$\\begin{aligned}\nr''_k+2\\frac{z'}{z}r'_k+k^2r_k=0,\\end{aligned}$$ where a prime denotes derivative with respect to the conformal time $d\\eta=dt/a$ and $$\\begin{aligned}\nz=a\\varphi'/{\\cal H}=\\lambda a M_{pl},\\end{aligned}$$ where ${\\cal H}=a'/a$ and we used for the last equality. Second, we assume that the field is in slow-roll regime, i.e. $p\\gg1$, and use the WKB approximation at $k\\gg{\\cal H}$, yielding the known results [@sasaki1986large], $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\cal P}_{{\\cal{R}}_c}(k)=\\frac{4\\pi k^3}{(2\\pi)^2}|r_k|^2\n=\\left(\\frac{H^2}{2\\pi\\dot{\\varphi}}\\right)^2\n=\\frac{p}{8\\pi^2}\\frac{H^2}{M^2_{pl}}\\end{aligned}$$ at $k={\\cal H}=Ha$, namely at the horizon crossing time. Rewriting the above in terms of $k$ gives the primordial curvature perturbation spectrum, $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\cal P}_{{\\cal{R}}_c}(k)=\\frac{p}{8\\pi^2}\\frac{H_0^2}{M^2_{pl}}\n\\left(\\frac{k}{k_0}\\right)^{\\frac{-2}{p-1}}\n\\label{scalar},\\end{aligned}$$ where $k_0$ is a reference wavenumber that crosses the horizon at $t=t_0$, and $H_0=p/t_0$. Similarly, the tensor perturbation spectrum is given by $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\cal P}_{{\\cal{T}}}(k)=\\frac{4\\pi k^3}{(2\\pi)^2}|h_k|^2\n=\\frac{2}{\\pi^2}\\frac{H^2}{M^2_{pl}}\n=\\frac{16}{p}{\\cal P}_{{\\cal{R}}_c}(k),\\end{aligned}$$ in agreement with the results of standard power-law inflation [@lucchin1985power]. For a more precise result, see [@lyth1992curvature].\n\nHere our main motivation to consider power-law inflation is because the model allows us to study it analytically. Nevertheless, it may be of some interest to check the current status of the observational constraints. The spectral index is given in terms of the parameter $p$ as $$\\begin{aligned}\nn_s-1=\\frac{d\\ln{\\cal P}_{{\\cal{R}}_c}}{d\\ln k}=\\frac{-2}{p-1}\\,,\\end{aligned}$$ which is slightly red, while the tensor to scalar ratio is given by $$\\begin{aligned}\nr=\\frac{{\\cal P}_{{\\cal{T}}}}{{\\cal P}_{{\\cal{R}}_c}}=\\frac{16}{p}\\,.\n\\label{r}\\end{aligned}$$ The most recent observational constraints are by Planck, which gives $n_{s,planck}\\approx 0.96$ and $r_{planck}<0.1$. From the former we obtain $p\\approx 50$, but this gives $r\\approx 0.32$ which is too large. This is a rather common feature of large field inflation models. However, this discrepancy can be alleviated by invoking a curvaton [@moroi2002cosmic; @enqvist2002adiabatic; @lyth2002generating]. Although our purpose is not to resolve the discrepancy but to study the matter's physics in the Jordan frame, regarding a curvaton as a representative of matter, it turns out that we can actually make power-law inflation observationally more attractive, as will be shown below.\n\nThe matter point of view {#}\n========================\n\nIn order to understand the matter point of view, we consider an almost massless curvaton $\\chi$ [@moroi2002cosmic; @enqvist2002adiabatic; @lyth2002generating] with sub-dominant energy density which plays no role in driving inflation. Therefore the inflationary dynamics is dictated by the inflaton $\\varphi$. The action of the spectator curvaton takes the usual form, $$\\begin{aligned}\nS_m=\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-\\tilde{g}}\n\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{g}^{\\mu\\nu}\n\\partial_\\mu\\chi\\partial_\\nu\\chi-\\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{m}^2\\chi^2\\right)\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\tilde{g}_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the metric of a particular Jordan frame and $\\tilde{m}$ is the mass of the curvaton in that frame. In general, after a conformal transformation the background is modified, $$\\begin{aligned}\nd\\tilde{s}^2=F^{-1}[\\varphi]ds^2=-d\\tilde{t}^2\n+\\tilde{a}^2d\\textbf{x}^2,\\end{aligned}$$ and the proper time and the scale factor are respectively redefined as $$\\begin{aligned}\nd\\tilde{t}=F^{-1/2}dt\\label{jtime}\\end{aligned}$$ and $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{a}=F^{-1/2}a.\\label{ja}\\end{aligned}$$ Consequently, the new conformal Hubble parameter is $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{\\cal H}={\\cal H}-F'/2F={\\cal H}\n\\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\frac{\\partial\\ln F}{\\partial \\varphi/M_{pl}}\\right),\n\\label{jhubble}\\end{aligned}$$ where has been used.\n\nIn passing, for this simple case, it may be worth noting how the frame independence of the quantization is realized inspite of the difference in the physical interpretation. First of all, if the conformal time is used as the time coordinate, the invariance of the canonical commutation relation is trivial. Consequently the invariance of the field equation is also trivial. Nevertheless it is instructive take a look at the differential equation for the mode function in each frame. In the Jordan frame it is $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\chi''_k+2\\tilde{\\cal H}\\chi'_k+(k^2+\\tilde{m}^2\\tilde{a}^2)\\chi_k=0.\n\\label{jmode}\\end{aligned}$$ In the Einstein frame where the action is $$\\begin{aligned}\nS_m=\\int d^4x \\frac{\\sqrt{-g}}{F}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}g^{\\mu\\nu}\n\\partial_\\mu\\chi\\partial_\\nu\\chi-\\frac{1}{2}m^2\\chi^2\\right),\\end{aligned}$$ where we redefined the mass by $m=F^{-1/2}\\tilde{m}$, the equation for the mode functions reads $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\chi''_k+2({\\cal H}-F'/2F)\\chi'_k+(k^2+m^2a^2)\\chi_k=0.\n\\label{emode}\\end{aligned}$$ Comparing both and , it is clear that they are exactly the same, but their interpretations are rather different. In fact, while is the usual differential equation for the mode functions of a canonical scalar field in a FLRW background, contains explicitly the effect of the non-canonical coupling with the inflaton in the kinetic term.\n\nIn any case, the resulting curvaton perturbation spectrum is frame independent. Keeping this in mind, we consider a couple of particular examples below separately. To begin with, we assume a slow-roll inflationary Einstein frame, i.e. $p\\gg 1$, unless otherwise noted.\n\nPower-law Jordan frame\\[case1\\]\n-------------------------------\n\n![Jordan conformal Hubble parameter as a function of conformal time $\\eta$.

Nevertheless since the original Einstein frame action is perfectly normal, the system is perfectly stable in spite of its seemingly disastrous appearance [@].\n\nIn this Jordan frame, we encounter another power-law with a different power law index $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{a}=a_0(\\tilde{t}/\\tilde{t}_0)^{\\tilde{p}},\\label{ja2}\\end{aligned}$$ in agreement with [@li2014generating], where the condition to obtain the scale-invariant tensor spectrum was discussed from the Jordan frame point of view. In we have integrated Jordan time $\\tilde{t}$ and replaced into the new scale factor , where the Jordan time $\\tilde{t}$ now runs from $0$ to $\\infty$ for $\\tilde{p}>1$ ($\\gamma<1$) and from $-\\infty$ to $0$ for $\\tilde{p}<1$ ($\\gamma>1$). Correspondingly, the Jordan power-law index and $\\tilde{t}_0$ are respectively related to those in the Einstein frame by $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{p}-1=\\frac{p-1}{1-\\gamma}\\label{ptilde}\\end{aligned}$$ and $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{t}_0=\\frac{t_0}{1-\\gamma}.\\label{t0}\\end{aligned}$$ It is interesting to note that from this Jordan frame is not restricted to $\\tilde{p}>1$ nor even $\\tilde{p}>0$. Thus, although an almost scale invariant spectrum is obtained independent of the frame, this Jordan frame may not be seen as an inflationary universe from the curvaton point of view, which is subject to the Jordan frame metric. This result reminds us of [@tsujikawa2000power], where the non-minimal coupling is used to \"assist\" inflation. In other words inflation is recovered in the Einstein frame even though the Jordan frame is not inflationary, thanks to the non-minimal coupling of the inflaton.\n\nIn this Jordan power-law, we encounter three general cases. First, for $\\gamma<1$, we have $\\tilde{p}>1$ and the curvaton also feels inflation with a different power-law index. The case $\\gamma=1$ corresponds to the exact exponential expansion. Second, for $1<\\gamma<p$ we have $\\tilde{p}<0$ and the curvaton experiences a super-inflationary universe, where by super-inflationary we mean that the universe expands faster than an exponential expansion. The behavior of the conformal Hubble parameter for $0<\\gamma<p$ ($\\tilde{p}<0$ and $\\tilde{p}>1$) is illustrated in Fig. \\[jhub\\]. Finally, for $\\gamma>p$, we have $0<\\tilde{p}<1$ and the curvaton is in a decelerated contracting universe. Note that $\\gamma>p$ implies $\\gamma^2>p/3$ for $p>1/3$. Hence this last case corresponds to the ghost-like gravity mentioned before.\n\n![Power spectrum in logarithmic scale for the power-law Jordan case. Inflaton curvature power spectrum (red line), tensor power spectrum (black line), super-inflationary curvaton power spectrum (blue line) and total scalar power spectrum (green line).[]{data-label=\"blue\"}](figure3.png){width=\"0.6\\columnwidth\"}\n\nIn order to compute the scalar power spectrum in this case we assume again that we are in the slow-roll regime, i.e. $|\\tilde{p}|\\gg1$, and use the WKB approximation inside the horizon and assume that a mode freezes out instantaneously at horizon crossing, which we call the instantaneous horizon exit assumption. The curvature perturbation spectrum due to the curvaton, under the sudden curvaton decay approximation [@lyth2002generating], is given by $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\cal P}_{\\chi}(k)=r_\\star\\frac{\\delta\\chi^2}{\\chi_\\star^2}=r_\\star\\frac{4\\pi k^3}{(2\\pi)^2}\\frac{|\\chi_k|^2}{\\chi_\\star^2}, \\label{powerchi}\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\chi_\\star$ is the background value of the curvaton field and $r_\\star=\\rho_{\\chi_\\star}/(\\rho+p)_{{\\rm tot}_\\star}$ is the energy density fraction of the curvaton at the time of decay. Note that for to be valid the curvaton must have a non-vanishing background value, which in turn implies $\\tilde{H}\\gg \\tilde{m}$ [@lyth2002generating; @bartolo2002simplest]. This condition is readily seen from the field equations of motions, i.e. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\ddot{\\chi}+3\\tilde{H}\\dot{\\chi}+\\tilde{m}^2\\chi^2=0,\\end{aligned}$$ where requiring $\\tilde{H}\\gg \\tilde{m}$ prevents the curvaton to settle down to its minimum. With the above assumptions we recover the usual scalar power spectrum, $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\cal P}_{\\chi}(k)=r_\\star\\frac{\\tilde{H}^2}{(2\\pi M_{pl}\\chi_\\star)^2}\n=r_\\star\\frac{\\tilde{H}_0^2}{M^2_{pl}\\chi_\\star^2}\n\\left(\\frac{k}{k_0}\\right)^{\\frac{-2}{\\tilde{p}-1}}\\,,\n\\label{powerchi2}\\end{aligned}$$ where the total scalar power spectrum is expressed as $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\cal P}_{\\rm tot}={\\cal P}_{{\\cal{R}}_c}+{\\cal P}_{\\chi}.\\end{aligned}$$ As a result, the new tensor to scalar ratio is given by [@fujita2014curvaton] $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{r}=\\frac{r}{1+{\\cal P}_{\\chi}/{\\cal P}_{{\\cal{R}}_c}}\\,.\n\\label{rtilde}\\end{aligned}$$ If we assume the curvaton energy density when it decays to be comparable to or greater than that due to the inflaton, $\\tilde{r}$ becomes small enough and the non-gaussianity parameter, $f_{NL}$, becomes $O(1)$ or smaller [@enqvist2013mixed; @byrnes2014comprehensive], making this scenario more consistent with the current observational data.\n\nThe curvaton spectral index can be easily extracted from . We obtain $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{n}_\\chi-1=\\frac{-2}{\\tilde{p}-1}\\,,\\end{aligned}$$ which need not be a red index. In particular, a blue tilt can be naturally achieved for $\\tilde{p}<0$, that is the super-inflationary situation, which is a common feature of super-inflationary models [@piao2004inflation; @piao2004phantom; @cicoli2014just; @biswas2014super; @liu2013cmb; @piao2003nearly]. See Fig. \\[blue\\]. This blue spectrum contribution can be important on small scales. For example, it may enhance the primordial black hole formation which can account for a fair amount of dark matter [@green2014primordial]. One may fairly wonder how important the back-reaction due to the large curvaton fluctuations would be. This would become important when the amplitude of the power spectrum became of order unity. However, before the back-reaction would become important, one would probably encounter an over-abundance of primordial black holes. This means that there should be a cutoff. Study on such a case may be of interest but it is beyond the scope of the present paper.\n\nJordan bouncing universe\\[case2\\]\n---------------------------------\n\n![Conformal Jordan squared hubble parameter (blue line) for the bouncing universe case and horizontal lines are constant $k$ lines. Shadowed region stands for super-horizon regime and the consequent freezing of the modes.[]{data-label=\"bounce\"}](figure4.png){width=\"0.6\\columnwidth\"}\n\nAs a second example, we consider a conformal transformation of the type, $$\\begin{aligned}\nF(\\varphi)=\\Big(1+\\textrm{e}^{\\frac{-\\gamma\\lambda}{2M_{pl}}\\varphi}\\Big)^{-2}\n=\\Big(1+(t/t_0)^{-\\gamma}\\Big)^{-2}\\,.\n\\label{fcase2}\\end{aligned}$$ For $\\gamma>0$ this reproduces the first example, subsection \\[case1\\], at early times ($t\\ll t_0$) and is just identical to the Einstein frame at late times ($t\\gg t_0$), and it is the other way around for $\\gamma<0$. From now on, we focus our attention on the case $\\gamma>1$ where the approximate behaviour of the scale factor is $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{a} \\approx \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\na_0(-\\tilde{t}/\\tilde{t}_0)^{\\tilde{p}} & \\quad |\\tilde{t}|\\gg\\tilde{t_0}\n& \\quad(\\tilde{t}<0)\n\\\\\na_0(\\tilde{t}/\\tilde{t}_0)^{p} & \\quad \\tilde{t}\\gg\\tilde{t_0}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.,\\end{aligned}$$ where the Jordan time, $\\tilde{t}$ , runs from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$.\n\nMost interestingly, for the case where $0<\\tilde{p}<1$ the curvaton is in a bouncing universe with bounce at $$\\begin{aligned}\nt_{bounce}=t_0\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{p}-1\\right)^{1/\\gamma}.\n\\label{tbounce}\\end{aligned}$$ Note that the big bang singularity in the Einstein frame is sent to $\\tilde{t}\\to-\\infty$ while the bounce occurs at a perfectly regular epoch in the Einstein frame. This model differs from usual bouncing cosmologies [@allen2004cosmological; @lyth2002primordial; @cai2007bouncing; @qiu2011bouncing] (for a review of bouncing cosmologies see [@battefeld2014critical]) in that the initial singularity is avoided from the matter point of view but it is still present in the gravitational sector. In order not to induce any confusion, let us call this a Jordan bouncing universe. In essence, the inflaton is preventing matter to feel the initial singularity through its non-canonical coupling. As a result, in this simple model the curvaton is in a bouncing universe where one can compute the resulting power spectrum due to a well defined initial vacuum state as $\\tilde{\\cal H}$ vanishes in the limit $\\eta\\rightarrow -\\infty$, $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{\\cal H}={\\cal H}\\left(1-\\frac{\\gamma}{p}\n\\frac{\\textrm{e}^{\\frac{-\\gamma\\lambda}{2}\\varphi}}\n{1+\\textrm{e}^{\\frac{-\\gamma\\lambda}{2}\\varphi}}\\right).\\end{aligned}$$\n\nBefore ending this section, we compute the curvaton power spectrum for the Jordan bouncing universe. It should be noted that, due to the bounce at $\\tilde{\\cal H}=0$, and a change from a decelerated contracting phase to an accelerated expanding phase at $\\tilde{\\cal H}'=0$, there appears a new critical scale $k_c$. See Fig. \\[bounce\\]. As schematically shown in the figure, the large scale modes $k<k_c$ go out of the Hubble horizon, re-enter the horizon before bounce, and go out of the horizon again during the final inflationary stage, while the small scale modes $k>k_c$ remain inside the horizon all through the contractig and bouncing stages until the final inflationary stage.\n\nMoreover, in order for the curvaton to contribute to the scalar power spectrum, it must have a non-vanishing background $\\chi=\\chi_0(\\eta)$, which implies that $\\tilde{H}\\gg \\tilde{m}$ has to be satisfied not only at late times but also at early times. We may achieve this condition by assuming an inflaton dependence in the mass of the curvaton, at least $\\tilde{m}[\\varphi]\\propto F^{1/2}[\\varphi]$ at early times.\n\n![Power spectrum for the bouncing universe (red line), super-inflationary to inflationary universe (blue line), curvature power spectrum (green line) and total scalar power spectrum for the bouncing case (black line).[]{data-label=\"powerfinal\"}](figure5.png){width=\"0.7\\columnwidth\"}\n\nIn this way, with the instantaneous horizon exit and reentry approximation for $k<k_c$, [^1] the mode functions for the curvaton when they are inside the horizon at the final inflationary stage are given by $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\chi_k \\approx \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2k}}\\frac{\\tilde{a}(\\eta_2)}{\\tilde{a}(\\eta_1)}\n\\frac{1}{\\tilde{a}(\\eta)} \\textrm{e}^{-\\textrm{i}k\\eta+i\\alpha_k}\n&\\quad k<k_c\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2k}}\\frac{1}{\\tilde{a}(\\eta)} \\textrm{e}^{-\\textrm{i}k\\eta}\n& \\quad k>k_c\n\\end{array}\n\\right.,\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\eta_1$ and $\\eta_2$ are, respectively, the horizon exit and reentry conformal times for modes with $k<k_c$. Although the instantaneous horizon exit and reentry approximation would break down for $\\tilde{p}\\ll1$, the resulting power spectrum can be still considered as a rough approximation. Again, making use of we obtain the power spectrum which we compute numerically because of the non trivial form of the scale factor around the bounce. The result is presented in Fig. \\[powerfinal\\]. As may be naively expected, the spectrum becomes blue on large scales.\n\nLastly, we also consider the case where a super-inflationary phase is present initially $\\tilde{p}<0$. In this case we do not need any particular assumption for the mass of the curvaton except for the condition $\\tilde{m}\\ll \\tilde{\\cal H}$, and we also obtain a blue spectrum on large scales, as shown in Fig. \\[powerfinal\\], though the blue tilt is not as sharp as the case of the Jordan bounce.\n\nConclusion {#}\n==========\n\nTo better understand the role of different conformal frames in cosmology, we considered a simple analytical model in which a scalar field, an inflaton, drives power-law inflation in the Einstein frame, and studied various Jordan frames associated with it by conformally transforming the metric, where a Jordan frame is defined as the frame in which matter is minimally coupled to the metric while the inflaton has a non-minimal coupling with the Ricci scalar. It should be noted that the predictions for both the tensor power spectrum and the curvature perturbation spectrum due to inflaton are unaltered in this setting. They are completely frame-independent and the same as those for the standard power-law inflation.\n\nParticular attention was paid to the physics from the matter point of view. The minimal coupling of matter with a certain Jordan frame metric is equivalent to a dilatonic coupling in the Einstein frame. But this simple difference can lead to a completely different picture of the universe. We studied two examples of how different the universe can be from the matter point of view.\n\nIn section \\[case1\\] we showed that matter can feel a super-inflationary universe or a decelerating contracting universe, even for a simple conformal transformation, inspired by the dilaton model , in spite of having inflation in the gravitational frame, i.e. the Einstein frame. Afterwards, as a representative of matter we considered a curvaton which significantly contributes to the total scalar power spectrum, leaving imprints of its minimal coupling to a particular Jordan metric. For instance, a blue tilt of the power spectrum on small scales can be obtained if the curvaton feels super-inflationary expansion, as shown in Fig. \\[blue\\], which can enhance the formation of primordial black holes.\n\nIn section \\[case2\\], we considered another particular conformal transformation which renders matter to feel a bouncing universe and therefore, as far as matter is concerned, the initial singularity is avoided. We obtained again the scalar power spectrum for a spectator curvaton, Fig. \\[powerfinal\\], which is blue tilted on large scales. In the case where the curvaton mainly generates the total scalar power spectrum, this can give rise to an apparent suppression of the power spectrum at large scales.\n\nTo conclude, we emphasise again that the purpose of this paper is not to make specific predictions for a particular class of non-minimal coupling models. With this simple but analytic example what we want to stress is how much the matter point of view, i.e. the Jordan frame point of view, can differ from the gravitational point of view, i.e. the Einstein frame point of view, and how this difference may actually affect observable quantities like the curvature perturbation spectrum.\n\nThe authors would like to thank T.
